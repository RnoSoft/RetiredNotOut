## A Warning

A long time ago, my wife was talking to a solicitor about terms and conditions for a website. The solicitor told her about a website developer who was fined several thousand pounds for using photographs without permission. The person who wanted the website supplied the photos; he had lifted them from a major photo library. The website developer did not bother checking they could be used. The photo library first went after the person who owned the website and got nowhere. Because the website had a link to the developer, they went after him and successfully sued him. This is the reason why I rarely write websites for other people.
