# About This Website

![Paul Chappell]

This is the personal website of Paul Chappell. I'm a 69-year-old retired computer programmer, living in Marsden, West Yorkshire, England. My favourite city is Liverpool, England. Mainly because I was born there, which makes me a scouser.

I'll be writing about anything that interests me, absolutely anything. However, my main interests are as follows:

## Photography

I've been interested in photography all my life.

It all started when I was at university in the mid-seventies. In those days there were no digital cameras, it was all film. In my study, I have a large box of slides and prints. I’m hoping to digitise some of them, in order to show them on this website (though there are issues doing this, see [this post](/photography/digitising-old-slides-negatives-and-prints)).

My current camera is a [Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ2000 bridge camera](https://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/cameras-camcorders/lumix-digital-cameras/bridge-cameras/dmc-fz2000.html), which I bought in September 2024. My previous digital camera broke earlier that year, it was a Canon EOS400D, which I bought in 2007 (it was getting old, like me!). 

For photo editing I use [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), it's open source and free. 

I'll be publishing a lot of my photographs (and some from my friends) on this website. *You are not allowed to use any of them without written permission, see my [copyright page](/copyright) for further information.*

Along time ago, I came across a website where someone was publishing a photo every day (or maybe most days). I've decided to nick this idea, see [here](/blog/daily-photograph).

## Travel

I've been lucky to travel abroad a lot in the past, but nowadays its mostly local. Around West Yorkshire and Merseyside. I'll be writing about my travels.

I've been a member of the [Campaign for Real Ale](https://camra.org.uk/) for over 50 years! I'll be writing about some of the more interesting pubs I visit. Like the [Ship and Mitre](https://theshipandmitre.uk/) Liverpool, one of my favourites.

## Science, Maths and Engineering

I've always been interested in these subjects. 

Back in the early/mid-seventies I did a civil engineering degree. I never became a civil engineer; I decided computer programming was much more interesting. The one thing I did learn on the course was how buildings are designed and built. For some reason, I've always loved big bridges.

The course taught me a lot about maths, most of it I've forgotten, but I really liked maths (well, someone must).

## Programming

I wrote my first computer program back in 1974 while at university, it changed my life. I decided to become a programmer rather than a civil engineer. I've now been programming for over 50 years, and things in the computer world have changed massively during that time. That's one of the interesting things about being a programmer for so long.

I'm now retired, though I still write code. I use the .Net framework, release 9, programming with the C# language. Some of it is open source.

## Websites

This is something I never thought I'd get into, throughout my career I never really programmed user interfaces.

I now write my own HTML, CSS and Java Script, as I am interested in very fast websites, websites that display in a browser very quickly. Html and Java Script where easy enough to learn (given that I've had 50 years’ experience of learning to program). CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was incredibly difficult.

# This Website's Design

This website is still under development, at this point in time I have no idea of what its final form will be. One of the reasons I'm writing it, is to learn more about the design and programming of small websites. As I learn more, the layout of the website will almost certainly change. 

This layout is article based. The [articles](/articles) page lists all the articles I have written. Each one has one or more categories, which are listed on the [categories](/categories) page. Clicking a category on the categories page displays a page listing all the articles for that category.
