<p>Yesterday, I also visited Halifax. I wanted some photos of the Christmas  market at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thepiecehall.co.uk/">Piece Hall</a>, which I assumed would be in full swing on a December Wednesday afternoon close to Christmas. It wasn’t, it was closed, serves me right for not checking.</p>

<p>The only shot I managed to get was the one above, but at least it’s a Christmas photo.</p>

<p>After that let down I went straight to the <a target="_blank" href="https://camra.org.uk/pubs/meandering-bear-halifax-town-centre-177680">Meandering Bear</a> for a bevvy. It’s a nice micro pub that’s in the good beer guide (it’s been in for years). Prices have gone up a lot since my last visit, though they did have Wishbone Blond at £4 a pint. I had a pint of it. It was ok but not full of flavour. I’m starting to get tired of blonde beers, these days I prefer traditional bitters, like the ones I was weaned on. The other real ales where around £5 a pint.</p>

<p>I asked the man who served my pint why there was no Christmas Market, he said its only at the weekend now.</p>

<p>When I thought about it, I remembered not seeing any Christmas lights in Hebden Bridge, I mentioned this. Someone at the bar said he’d been there yesterday and was surprised there were none this year. There didn’t seem to be many Christmas lights in Halifax, I eventually found some, but not many.</p>

<p>When I got back to Marsden, I noticed there were no Christmas lights in the village centre this year.</p>

<p>Must be the state of the economy and all the tax rises we’ve had to suffer.</p>

<p>I need three or four Christmas photos for some journal posts I’m planning, god knows where I’m going to get them.</p>

<h2 id="update-16th-december-2025">Update 16th December 2025</h2>

<p>Today I visited Wigan.</p>

<p>Walking round the town centre I could not see much evidence of Christmas lights.</p>

<p>However, I was wrong about Marsden. I got back to the village around half six and saw the Christmas lights. They were switched on, on Saturday 6th December, a few days after my original post.</p>
