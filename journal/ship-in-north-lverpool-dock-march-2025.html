<p>When driving home from Liverpool the other day, I also drove along Liverpool’s dock road, to see if there were any interesting photos to be had. The only one I got was the one above. Most of the docks and ships where hidden behind walls. The ship was behind a large steel fence, which made taking the photo difficult.</p>

<p>I was planing to go to Everton’s new football ground; I was hoping to get to the Mersey to see if there were any interesting photos to be taken. No chance, the ground is hidden behind a large wall. On that wall, at regular intervals, there are signs saying no photographs or social media. So, I didn’t bother taking any. Though there was nothing to stop me taking photos of the wall and the new stadium towering above it, from the road. You have the right to take photos in a public place. Whats the point of banning photography at the stadium; stupid.</p>

<p>Recently I was at Liverpool’s ground, no problem taking photos there.</p>

<p>I was born in Liverpool, which makes me a scouser. When I travel, I usually tell people I come from Liverpool (a much more interesting place than Marsden, and often leads to a more interesting conversation), they nearly always say, which team do you support, Red’s or Blue’s.</p>

<p>My answer is always, <strong>I hate football</strong>.</p>
