<p class="p-image-description">Berwick-Upon-Tweed Bay, December 2007.</p>

<p>The national living wage for people over 20 is going up by 50p an hour from next April, that’s a 4.1% increase. According to the office of national statistics, the average working week is 36.5 hours. So, that’s an increase of £18.25 a week or £949 a year. <em>A well needed increase for the poorly paid</em>.</p>

<p>Because the personal tax allowance has been frozen (see my <a href="/journal/tax-personal-allowance-frozen-november-2025">previous post</a>). Twenty percent tax is paid on the increase. Six percent national insurance (NI) is also paid. The tax and NI is £246.74. The worker receives £702.26.</p>

<p>Had the allowance been increased by 4.1%, the worker would not have paid any tax on the pay rise. The increase might have been just 2%, more tax would be paid, but not as much as with the frozen allowance.</p>

<p>If someone earning £49,000 receives a pay rise of £949 a year, the increased tax and NI would be the same!</p>

<p>Everyone receiving a pay rise that keeps them below the higher rate tax band loses 0.26% of it. Had the personal allowance not been frozen, the loss would have been less. It would depend on the pay rise and the increase in the personal allowance.</p>

<p>This will continue until 2031.</p>

<p>The employer also pays 15% NI on the £949, which is £142.35. This means the chancellor is getting £389.09 for everyone on the national living wage, it’s also costing the employer £1,091.39.</p>

<h2 id="national-insurance-increase-2024">National Insurance Increase 2024</h2>

<p>In the 2024 budget, the chancellor raised the national living wage from £11.44 to £12.21 an hour. An increase of 77 pence per hour, £28.10 a week or £1,461.46 a year.</p>

<p>This took the average yearly pay for someone on the national living wage to £23,174.58.</p>

<p>A big problem last year was the changes that the chancellor made to employers NI. The rate was increased from 13.8% to 15%. The amount at which the rate kicks in was dropped from £9,100 to £5,000. The employer now has to pay NI at 15% on an extra £4,100, £615 (the employer has to find this amount for every employee). The employer also has to pay an extra 1.2% on earnings above £9,100. For £23,174.58 that’s £168.89. The increase in employer NI is £783.89.</p>

<p>The 2024 employers wage and NI increases cost them £2,245.35 per year per worker.</p>

<p>Add in this year’s costs, employers are having to find an extra £3,336.74 for each worker on the national living wage, over the last two years.</p>

<h2 id="swings-and-roundabouts">Swings and Roundabouts</h2>

<p>Clearly, we need to increase the wages for the poor.</p>

<p>We also need to do it in a way that does not push up costs, increase unemployment and drive companies abroad. How this is done is up to the politicians.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have a government that has said it will not increase taxes, NI and VAT for workers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these need to be increased to spread the cost more evenly. Increasing employer NI, fine, but dropping the rate by £4,100, not at all sure about that.</p>
