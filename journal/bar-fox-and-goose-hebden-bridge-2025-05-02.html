<p>Today I caught the bus to Hebden Bridge to have a look around, take some photos and drink some real ale in two of the town’s most interesting pubs.</p>

<p>The above photo shows the bar of the <a href="https://www.foxandgoose.org">Fox and Goose</a>, the first one I visited.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://heavywoollen.camra.org.uk/">local CAMRA branch</a> has awarded it numerous <em>pub of the year</em> awards. Recently, the branch gave it it’s <em>cider pub of the year</em> award. You can enjoy your drink in the bar or one of the adjacent rooms. If the weather is nice you can sit in the garden, but be warned it’s two, maybe three, flights of stairs above the bar! Hebden Bridge is very hilly. I had two pints of bitter, both around 4%, costing £3.80 and £4.20. Excellent value.</p>

<p>It’s a proper <em>community owned</em> pub, see <a href="https://www.foxandgoose.org/about-us">this page</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The other one I visited was <a href="https://camra.org.uk/pubs/drink-hebden-bridge-177495">Drink</a>, it’s a micropub and is also well worth a visit. There is a large selection of bottled beers to drink in or take away. They usually have three real ales on tap; I had two pints of porter at £4.20 a pint. Again, excellent value.</p>

<p>Over the years my wife and I have come across several community owned/micro pubs, and they’ve all been worth visiting. Mainly because they are delivering what the locals actually want and are nearly always competitive on price. They are not owned by a big pubco or brewery with lots of managers to pay.</p>

<p>The other good thing about these two pubs is that they do not serve food. You can sit and enjoy your pint without the smell of food. If you’re hungry, I recommend fish and chips from <em>The Crown Street Fisheries</em> (on Crown Street), I ate mine in the park just around the corner.</p>

<p>CAMRA writes about community-owned pubs <a href="https://camra.org.uk/community-pubs">here</a>. You need to be careful, a lot of pubs are described as community pubs, but are not owned by the community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ukmicropubs.co.uk/micropub-region/north-west/">This website</a> might help you locate micropubs near you.</p>
