<p>Today I caught the bus to Hebden Bridge, to have a look around, take some photos and drink some real ale in two of the town’s most interesting bars.</p>

<p>The above photo shows the bar of the <a href="https://www.foxandgoose.org/about-us">Fox and Goose</a> public house in Hebden Bridge. This was the first one I visited.</p>

<p>It’s well worth a visit for a pint or two. The <a href="https://heavywoollen.camra.org.uk/">local CAMRA branch</a> has awarded it numerous <em>pub of the year</em> awards. Recently, the branch gave it it’s <em>cider pub of the year</em> award. You can enjoy your drink in the bar or one of the adjacent rooms. If the weather is nice you can sit in the garden, but be warned, it’s two flights of stairs above the bar! Hebden Bridge is very hilly. I had two pints of bitter, both around 4%, costing £3.80 and £4.20.</p>

<p>The other one I visited was <a href="https://camra.org.uk/pubs/drink-hebden-bridge-177495">Drink</a>, it’s a micropub and is well worth a visit. There is a large selection of bottled beers to drink in or take away. They have three real ales on tap, I had two pints of porter at £4.20 a pint.</p>

<p>Over the years my wife and I have come across several community pubs and micropubs, and they’ve all been worth visiting. Mainly because they are delivering what the locals actually want, and not what some manager 200 miles away thinks they want. They are nearly always competitive on price. Mainly because they are owned by the community or the person running the pub. They are not owned by a big company.</p>

<p>If you are hungry, I recommend fish and chips from <em>The Crown Street Fisheries</em>, I ate mine in the park just around the corner.</p>

<p>CAMRA writes about community pubs <a href="https://camra.org.uk/community-pubs">here</a>. You need to be careful, a lot of pubs are described as community pubs, but are not owned by the community.</p>
