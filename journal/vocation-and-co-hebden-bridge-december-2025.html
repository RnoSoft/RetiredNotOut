<p>Today I went to Hebden Bridge and Halifax to take some photos and enjoy some fine real ale.</p>

<p>In Hebden Bridge I was hoping to get some winter photos of the canal. I didn’t get any, the sun was not shining, and it was cloudy (the weather forecast said sunny!).</p>

<p>So I gave up and went to this <a target="_blank" href="https://camra.org.uk/pubs/vocation-co-hebden-bridge-177634">pub</a>, well worth a visit, it’s in the 2026 good beer guide.</p>

<p>They had four ales on hand pump, and as seen in the photo above, a lot of craft keg beers. There were two keg beers (16 and 20) with a strength greater than 10%, at £7.50 a half (not for me). There were also two traditional ciders on offer. Being a real-ale man, I had two pints of Bread and Butter bitter (£4.50) and a pint of  Heart and Soul (£4.70), both were excellent.</p>

<p>They do food, mainly burgers and loaded chips. I fancied a plate of chips, with cheese and bacon (£9.50). But I heard the call of the chippy round the corner and went there for fish and chips. It’s the chippy I visited last May, see <a href="/journal/chip-shop-hebden-bridge-may-2">this post</a>.</p>

<p>The pub is very close to the Rochdale canal and the town centre.</p>

<p>While in Hebden Bridge a visit to the Fox and Goose and Drink are well worth it. I visited these pubs last May, and wrote about them <a href="/journal/bar-fox-and-goose-hebden-bridge-2025-05-02">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buying-a-fleece">Buying a Fleece</h2>

<p>Another reason I went to Hebden Bridge was to myself a fleece. Rohan (who seem to make fine fleeces) has a shop there, unfortunately there was not a lot of stock as it’s a small shop. The lady who was serving said they had one or two of each type of fleece. You could select what you wanted, and have it delivered to the shop for free (not an option, it’s 20 to 30 miles away) or delivered to your home (£4.95 for standard delivery, though returns are free). This doesn’t work as I want to try on a fleece that fits me, in the shop. I won’t be buying anything from this shop.</p>

<p>I’ve written about the problems of buying from shops before, see <a href="/journal/problems-shopping-september-2025">this journal post</a>.</p>
