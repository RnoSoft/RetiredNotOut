<p>This photo is a view along the canal in Hebden Bridge.</p>

<p>I spent yesterday afternoon wandering around Hebden Bridge, more about that in <a href="/journal/bar-fox-and-goose-hebden-bridge-2025-05-02">yesterday’s post</a>. It was also the day that local councils were counting the results of the local and mayoral elections the day before.</p>

<p>As I wandered around the town, I had to keep looking at my mobile phone to see how the counts were going. They were not good for the big established parties, the Tories and Labour. <em>Both</em> lost around two-thirds of their councillors. The main beneficiary was Reform, though the Liberals also gained seats.</p>

<p>One of the elections was for the Mayor of Doncaster. Labour won with 23,805 votes (32.4%); Reform was second with 23,107 (31.5%), very close; the Tories were third with 18,982 (25.9%). Because of the first past the post system, labour won with just 32.4% of the vote. Over 50% of people who voted did not vote for Labour. The turnout was just over 32%, very, very poor. If you look at the politics, 32.4% voted for left wing Labour. 62.8%, the majority, voted for right wing parties (The Tories and Reform). Doncaster ended up with a Labour mayor and a Reform council!</p>

<p>In last year’s general election, Labour got 412 seats, around 65% of the seats in parliament, with just 33.7% (219) of the vote; the Tories 121 seats with 23.7% (154); the Liberal Democrats 72 with 12.2% (79); Reform 5 seats with 14.3% (93); and the Greens 4 with 6.7% (43). The figures in brackets show the number of seats as a percentage of the vote gained. Labour won the most seats, but they did not have a majority of voters. The turnout was around 60%.</p>

<p>It’s becoming increasingly clear that there is a problem with our voting system, first past the post, a big, big problem.</p>

<p>We need to move towards proportional representation. Back in January I joined the <a href="https://electoral-reform.org.uk/" target="_blank"><em>Electoral Reform Society</em></a>, when I realised things must change.</p>

<p>Their website covers the issue in detail (far better than I ever can), including the different types of proportional representation, and makes interesting reading.</p>
