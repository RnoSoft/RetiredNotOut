<p>Today my sister got back from her holiday, so it was time to return home.</p>

<p>Tonight, John was going to see a close friend’s son play the drums. He was staying in the Travel Lodge at Salford Quays, a short distance by tram from Eccles. To save him catching the train to Manchester, I took him to Eccles (which was on my way home) and dropped him off at this pub. He could then have a few pints before going to his hotel. The tram stop is right outside the pub.</p>

<p>I’ve been visiting this <a href="https://camra.org.uk/pubs/lamb-hotel-eccles-170906" target="_blank">pub</a> on and off since the late 1970’s when I discovered the Holts Brewery. Their beers are excellent and keenly priced. I had a quick pint of mild (I was keen to get home) at £2.70. John later told me that the bitter was £3.40 a pint. It’s in this and next year’s good beer guide. It’s won several awards. It really is a good pub to visit for a few hours.</p>

<p>The pub is rated three stars on Camra’s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.</p>

<p>As you can see from the photo, it was raining, the tail end of storm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Amy" target="_blank">Amy</a> was passing by. It passed by on Friday and Saturday, and meant I couldn’t do much, especially photography. On Friday I had an afternoon session with john in the <a href="https://camra.org.uk/pubs/baltic-fleet-liverpool-165741" target="_blank">Baltic Fleet</a>. On Saturday I had an afternoon session with john in the <a href="https://camra.org.uk/pubs/vernon-arms-liverpool-165852" target="_blank">Vernon Arms</a>. John tells me the Vernon does excellent food at a decent price, though only on weekdays.</p>
