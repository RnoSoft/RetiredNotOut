<p>Today my wife and I decided to have a look around Tynemouth and catch the ferry across the river from North to South Shields. It’s easy enough getting there if you use the metro. An all-day ticket costs £6.70 and includes the ferry and buses.</p>

<p>Tynemouth station is old and full of Victorian iron work. There’s a <a href="https://tynemouthmarkets.com/" target="_blank">market</a> there every Saturday and Sunday, it looks interesting, well worth a visit.</p>

<p>We had a good walk along the seafront until it started to rain. I’ll be publishing some of the photos I took soon.</p>

<p>We had a coffee while we waited for it to stop. And then risked a walk out to the <a href="https://camra.org.uk/pubs/tynemouth-lodge-hotel-tynemouth-193173" target="_blank">Tynemouth Lodge Hotel</a>, about 15 minutes out of town along the main road to North Shields (called Tynemouth Road!). The first part of the walk was along the main drag; from the coffee shop it looked like there would be some interesting shops. Wrong, it was full of cafes, bars and restaurants.</p>

<p>The pub is excellent and opens at noon every day. We arrived around 12:30 and it was empty. By the time we left, a few hours later, two more people had arrived. It’s been owned by the same person for over 40 years; it’s been in the Good Beer Guide for over 40 years.</p>

<p>We spent a couple of hours there, talking to the barman and between ourselves. They had five real ales, one of them was Draught Bass. My pint cost £4.30 (a relief after yesterday’s drinks in Newcastle city centre).</p>

<p>The barman was a mine of information. He told us that Tynemouth was a very expensive place to drink, apart from this pub, of course. It’s one of the signs of a good pub, staff behind the bar talking to you.</p>

<p>This is an excellent pub; a must be visited one. It’s been a public house and residential hotel (though not now) since 1799. A blue plaque  outside says <em>there used to be a house of correction next door, meals for the inmates were cooked in the hotel, and carried to the inmates through an underground tunnel.</em></p>

<p>Some of the TV series Vera was filmed in Tynemouth. Being a big fan of the drama, I was hoping to spot some of the film locations (I didn’t). Due to the rain (and tiredness, being old I cannot walk as far as I used to, see this <a href="/journal/centre-of-slaithwaite-june-2025">post</a>) we decided to curtail our walk along the coast. Which, along with this pub, gives an excellent excuse to return.</p>

<p>Next, we caught the ferry over to South Shields (there’s not much of interest in North Shields). I’ll be publishing some of the photos I took soon, though here’s one of the ferry coming over from South Shields to pick us up. My <a href="/journal/the-steamboat-pub-shouth-shields-september-2025">next</a> journal post covers what happened after we arrived.</p>
