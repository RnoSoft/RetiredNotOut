<p>The photo shows a steam train arriving at Bury Station. There are more photos of steam and diesel trains at Bury Station and on the East Lancs Railway, <a href="/blog/a-train-ride-on-the-east-lancs-railway">here</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I’ve had a lot of trouble trying to get <a href="https://tfw.wales/plan-a-journey" target="_blank">Transport for Wales</a> to answer some questions about rail tickets.</p>

<h2 id="heart-of-wales-circular-ranger">Heart of Wales Circular Ranger</h2>

<p>The Heart of Wales railway is very interesting; it goes through some magnificent Welsh countryside and is well worth traveling on. The railway line starts in Shrewsbury and ends in Swansea. It takes about four hours.</p>

<p>There’s another interesting route between the two cities, along the Welsh Marches (the Wales/England Border), traveling through Newport, Hereford and Ludlow. The trip also takes around four hours.</p>

<p>Transport for Wales have a <a href="https://tfw.wales/ways-to-travel/rail/ticket-types/rovers-and-rangers/heart-wales" target="_blank">circular ranger ticket</a> that allows you to travel both routes. It’s valid for one or two days. You can stop off wherever you want. It’s a shame it’s not valid for three or four days, which would be much more useful.</p>

<p>A trip I’m looking at doing is catching the train from Shrewsbury to Swansea along the Marches, stopping of at various towns along the way for refreshments (which means decent real ale!). A couple of nights in Swansea (I’ve only been there once, fifty years ago, for a few hours). Returning along the Heart of Wales line stopping off at one or two places overnight. It’s a real shame this cannot be done with the ranger ticket.</p>

<p>With a monthly open return, it seems you travel all the way on the date of the outward ticket, most allow a break of journey. You can return anytime within a month, with a break of journey. It seems that on the return part you can break the journey overnight. I’ve had this confirmed by several train guards and rejected by one.</p>

<p>I needed to confirm this, so I contacted them using the <strong>contact form on their website</strong>. They failed to respond. So, I contacted them again, they failed to respond. So, I contacted them again….. After three attempts I gave up (and yes, I double checked my email address to make sure it was correct). I wanted to use the contact form so I could get a written reply, in case I got an awkward guard.</p>

<p>I also wanted to know how much a monthly open return was, going out in one direction and returning in the other, and if a break of journey is allowed, especially overnight. It seemed to be impossible using their website.</p>

<h2 id="ffestiniog-round-robin">Ffestiniog Round Robin</h2>

<p>Another very interesting trip from Transport for Wales is the <a href="https://tfw.wales/ways-to-travel/rail/ticket-types/rovers-and-rangers/ffestiniog-round-robin" target="_blank">Ffestiniog Round Robin</a>.</p>

<p>I looked at doing this a number of years ago, but decided it was impossible. Back then I assumed the trip had to be done in a single day. Which was very, very difficult because you had to get the train from Llandudno to Blaenau Ffestiniog (or vice vera) and there were very few trains between the two towns. If a train was cancelled, the whole trip fell apart. There were also difficulties co-ordinating trains at Blaenau Ffestiniog.</p>

<p>I was looking at the web page for the trip the other day, it says the ticket is valid for a single journey. Unfortunately, it does not say if the journey can be done over multiple days. I needed an answer to that. I was thinking of two nights in Machynlleth, with a side trip to Aberystwyth. Then two nights in Porthmadog, spending a day photographing the steam trains on the Ffestiniog Railway.</p>

<p>So, I went to the Transport for Wales website to get their contact number. I repeat, I went to the Transport for Wales website.</p>

<p>I rang the number, the person who answered could not answer my question. He suggested I contact Transport for Wales; I kid you not, that’s what he said. It seems the contact number for them puts you through to national rail enquiries (hmmmm).</p>

<p>So, another question I cannot get an answer to.</p>

<p>What’s wrong with them?</p>

<p>I think I’m going to have to write to their managing director.</p>
