<p><img class="float-image-left maxwidth-35" src="/content/home/paul.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell" /></p>

<p>My name is Paul Chappell, I’m a 68-year-old retired computer programmer. To keep my mind active, I’ve decided to start a blog.</p>

<p>First, I must decide what to blog about. There are many articles about this on the internet. Most suggest a niche subject, maybe photography, maths, travel, computer programming, all things that interest me. Well, this is my blog, so I’m the niche, so I’ll blog about anything that interests me.</p>

<p>I’ve been a keen photographer all my life, so there will be posts showing my photos.</p>

<p>It all started when I was at university in the mid-seventies. In those days there were no digital cameras, it was all film. In my study, I have a large box of slides and prints. I’m hoping to digitise some of them, in order to use them in this blog (though there are issues doing this, see this <a href="/digitising-old-slides-negatives-and-prints">post</a>).</p>

<p>In 2007 I bought a digital SLR. It’s getting very old now, but it still works. I’m hoping to replace it later this year. I also use my mobile phone. For photo editing I use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, it’s open source and free.</p>

<p><img class="float-image-right maxwidth-35" src="/content/home/paul-edge-hill.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell at Edge Hill Station in 1977" /></p>

<p>The photograph of me on the right was taken by my friend John Buckley at Edge Hill railway station, in 1977.</p>

<p>I’ve always been interested in maths.</p>

<p>Back in the early/mid-seventies I did a civil engineering degree, the maths got very interesting and difficult (in the third year we covered waves crashing into beaches, I gave up there!). It’s almost 50 years since I finished the degree, I’ve forgotten most of it.</p>

<p>In 1971 I took my ‘O’ level maths, I still have one of the papers. When thinking about what to blog about, I thought I would publish it on this blog and write about re-learning the maths necessary to answer the questions. Unfortunately, I cannot get permission to publish it, <strong>even though it is over 50 years old!</strong></p>

<p>I’ve decided I’m still going to blog about maths, but I’m going to blog about the bits that interest me. Like prime numbers, relativity and tides, things I’ve been thinking about recently.</p>

<p>The blog will also contain posts about my travels. I’ve been lucky to travel abroad a lot in the past, but nowadays its mostly local. Around West Yorkshire and Merseyside.</p>

<p>I’ve been a member of the <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">Campaign for Real Ale</a> for over 50 years! I will also blog about some of the more interesting pubs I visit. Like the <a href="https://theshipandmitre.uk/">Ship and Mitre</a> LIverpool, one of my favourites.</p>

<p>I’ve been a  computer programmer since the late seventies. I will blog about computer programming, but not very often (I want people to read this blog!). One thing I’m going to write about is developing websites with the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll Static Website Generator</a>, and hosting them for free with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. But not on this website, on another of my <a href="https://jekyllwebsites.retirednotout.uk">websites</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/blog">blog page</a> lists all my posts, latest first.</p>

<p>All my posts have been tagged; the tags are listed <a href="/blog/tags">here</a>. All tags have been categorised by photography, travel, maths, computers and miscellaneous. Hopefully, this will make it easier to locate posts that might interest you.</p>
