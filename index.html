<p>Now that I’m retired, I have lots of time on my hands, so I’ve decided to write a blog. It’s called Retired Not Out. After a lot of though, rather than having a single blog that covers everything, I decided to have multiple blogs. I’m told this approach is better for Search Engine Optimisation. It also means you don’t have to wade through posts that don’t interest you. This page provides a brief description of each sub-blog and a link to it.</p>

<h2 id="personal-blog">Personal Blog</h2>

<p>This contains all of my posts that are <em>not about</em> software. It’s mainly about photography but also contains posts about my travels and the various non-software related things I get up to. It’s <a href="https://blog.retirednotout.uk">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="software-blog">Software Blog</h2>

<p>I’ve been a professional coder all my working life, starting in 1978! And, with retirement I’m not going to give up. This blog contains all of my posts <em>about</em> software. If you are not into writing software (using .Net and C#) and websites, this blog is not for you. It’s <a href="https://software.retirednotout.uk">here</a>.</p>
