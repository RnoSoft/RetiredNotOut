<p><img class="float-image-left maxwidth-35" src="/content/home/paul.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell" /></p>

<p>My name is Paul Chappell, I’m a 68-year-old retired computer programmer. To keep my mind active, I’ve decided to start a blog.</p>

<p>There are many articles about what you should blog about on the internet. Most suggest a niche subject, maybe photography, science, travel, computer programming, all things that interest me. Well, this is my blog, so I’m the niche, so I’ll blog about anything that interests me.</p>

<p>I’m going to tag all my posts, to make it easier for you to find similar posts to the one you have just read.</p>

<p>I’m also grouping my posts into categories, initially I will categorise by photography, travel and science. Posts that do not fit into these categories  will miscellaneous posts. I may add new categories in the future.</p>

<h4 id="photography">Photography</h4>

<p><img class="float-image-right maxwidth-35" src="/content/home/paul-edge-hill.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell at Edge Hill Station in 1977" /></p>

<p>The photograph of me on the right was taken by my friend John Buckley at Edge Hill railway station, in 1977.</p>

<p>I’ve been a keen photographer all my life, so there will be posts showing my photos.</p>

<p>It all started when I was at university in the mid-seventies. In those days there were no digital cameras, it was all film. In my study, I have a large box of slides and prints. I’m hoping to digitise some of them, in order to use them in this blog (though there are issues doing this, see this <a href="/digitising-old-slides-negatives-and-prints">post</a>).</p>

<p>In 2007 I bought a digital SLR. It’s getting very old now, but it still works. I’m hoping to replace it later this year. I also use my mobile phone. For photo editing I use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, it’s open source and free.</p>

<h4 id="science">Science</h4>

<p>I’ve always been interested in science, maths and engineering.</p>

<p>Back in the early/mid-seventies I did a civil engineering degree. I never became a civil engineer; I decided computer programming was much more interesting. The one thing I did learn on the course was how buildings are designed and built. For some reason, I’ve always loved big bridges.</p>

<p>The course taught me a lot about maths, most of it I’ve forgotten, but I really liked maths. I’d like to start learning some of it again.</p>

<p>Science was always fun (except for chemistry, I never got the hang of it).</p>

<p>So, there is plenty to write about here (and don’t worry, I won’t write about computer programming very often).</p>

<p><img class="float-image-left maxwidth-35" src="/content/home/mersey-ferry.jpg" alt="The Mersey Ferry coming into Seacombe" /></p>

<p>The photograph on the left is the Mersey Ferry coming into the Seacombe landing stage.</p>

<h4 id="travel">Travel</h4>

<p>I’ve been lucky to travel abroad a lot in the past, but nowadays its mostly local. Around West Yorkshire and Merseyside. I’ll be writing about my travels.</p>

<p>I’ve been a member of the <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">Campaign for Real Ale</a> for over 50 years! I’ll be writing about some of the more interesting pubs I visit. Like the <a href="https://theshipandmitre.uk/">Ship and Mitre</a> Liverpool, one of my favourites.</p>

<h4 id="creating-this-website">Creating this Website</h4>

<p>This website was built with the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static website generator</a>. It is free to use, open-source software.</p>

<p>The theme for the website was written by me. It’s still a work in progress, as I lean new programming techniques the website will gradually improve. Ultimately, I’ll publish the theme as open-source software for anybody to use.</p>

<p>The website is hosted for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, because it is a personal website.</p>

<p>So, writing and hosting the website is completely free, including editing your photos.</p>

<p>I’ll be writing about how I developed the theme for the website, but not here, on another <a href="http://jekyllwebsites.retirednotout.uk/">website</a> dedicated to writing websites.</p>
