<p>I’m a retired computer programmer, with lots of time on his hands, who’s decided to write a blog. It’s called <em>Retired Not Out</em>. After a lot of thought, rather than having a single blog that covers everything, I’ve decided to have two. One that <em>is not about</em> software (my personal blog) and one that <em>is</em> (my software blog). People who write software might be interested in my personal posts; but people who do not will almost certainly not be interested in my software posts.</p>

<p>My personal blog is <a href="https://blog.retirednotout.uk">here</a>. It’s mainly about photography but also contains posts about my travels and the various non-software related things I get up to.</p>

<p>My software blog is <a href="https://software.retirednotout.uk">here</a>. It contains posts about software: writing software with the C# language and the latest releases of .Net; writing software with typescript and java script; creating websites; and using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to create static websites.</p>

<p>Just because I’m retired, I’m not giving up writing software, I’m currently writing some open-source software that might be useful to people developing websites. Back in 2019, I wrote a website for my cousin, listing the people of Ulverston killed in action during <em>World War One</em>. The original website was written with Microsoft’s Asp.Net Core software. I’m currently in the process of porting it to the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static website generator.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ulverstonfallen.uk/world-war-one/fallen/atkinson-isaac-private">original website</a> listed the fallen and had the ability to filter the list. I’m writing some software that can create a Jekyll collection from a data source such as an excel spreadsheet, a database or a comma separated file. It will be able to create Java Script code to allow items in the collection to be filtered, this code will be able to run in the browser or as a serverless function in the cloud. This <a href="https://jekyllcollection.retirednotout.uk">part</a> of my website describes this program, and how to download it.</p>
