    <h1 id="about-this-website">About This Website</h1>

<p><img class="float-image-left" src="/content/index/paul.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell" /></p>

<p>This is the personal website of Paul Chappell. I’m a 69-year-old retired computer programmer, living in Marsden, West Yorkshire, England. My favourite city is Liverpool, England. Mainly because I was born there, which makes me a scouser.</p>

<p>I’ll be writing about anything that interests me, absolutely anything. However, my main interests are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>

<p>I’ve been interested in photography all my life.</p>

<p>It all started when I was at university in the mid-seventies. In those days there were no digital cameras, it was all film. In my study, I have a large box of slides and prints. I’m hoping to digitise some of them, in order to show them on this website (though there are issues doing this, see <a href="/photography/digitising-old-slides-negatives-and-prints">this post</a>).</p>

<p>My current camera is a <a href="https://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/cameras-camcorders/lumix-digital-cameras/bridge-cameras/dmc-fz2000.html">Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ2000 bridge camera</a>, which I bought in September 2024. My previous digital camera broke earlier that year, it was a Canon EOS400D, which I bought in 2007 (it was getting old, like me!).</p>

<p>For photo editing I use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, it’s open source and free.</p>

<p>I’ll be publishing a lot of my photographs (and some from my friends) on this website. <em>You are not allowed to use any of them without written permission, see my <a href="/copyright">copyright page</a> for further information.</em></p>

<p>Along time ago, I came across a website where someone was publishing a photo every day (or maybe most days). I’ve decided to nick this idea, see <a href="/blog/daily-photograph">here</a>.</p>

<p><img class="float-image-right" src="/content/index/paul-edge-hill.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell at Edge Hill Station in 1977" /></p>

<p>The photograph of me on the right was taken by my friend John Buckley at Edge Hill railway station, in 1977.</p>

<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>

<p>I’ve been lucky to travel abroad a lot in the past, but nowadays its mostly local. Around West Yorkshire and Merseyside. I’ll be writing about my travels.</p>

<p>I’ve been a member of the <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">Campaign for Real Ale</a> for over 50 years! I’ll be writing about some of the more interesting pubs I visit. Like the <a href="https://theshipandmitre.uk/">Ship and Mitre</a> Liverpool, one of my favourites.</p>

<h2 id="science-maths-and-engineering">Science, Maths and Engineering</h2>

<p>I’ve always been interested in these subjects.</p>

<p>Back in the early/mid-seventies I did a civil engineering degree. I never became a civil engineer; I decided computer programming was much more interesting. The one thing I did learn on the course was how buildings are designed and built. For some reason, I’ve always loved big bridges.</p>

<p>The course taught me a lot about maths, most of it I’ve forgotten, but I really liked maths (well, someone must).</p>

<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>

<p>I wrote my first computer program back in 1974 while at university, it changed my life. I decided to become a programmer rather than a civil engineer. I’ve now been programming for over 50 years, and things in the computer world have changed massively during that time. That’s one of the interesting things about being a programmer for so long.</p>

<p>I’m now retired, though I still write code. I use the .Net framework, release 9, programming with the C# language. Some of it is open source.</p>

<h2 id="websites">Websites</h2>

<p>This is something I never thought I’d get into, throughout my career I never really programmed user interfaces.</p>

<p>I now write my own HTML, CSS and Java Script, as I am interested in very fast websites, websites that display in a browser very quickly. Html and Java Script where easy enough to learn (given that I’ve had 50 years’ experience of learning to program). CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was incredibly difficult.</p>

<h1 id="this-websites-design">This Website’s Design</h1>

<p>This website is still under development, at this point in time I have no idea of what its final form will be. One of the reasons I’m writing it, is to learn more about the design and programming of small websites. As I learn more, the layout of the website will almost certainly change.</p>

<p>This layout is article based. The <a href="/articles">articles</a> page lists all the articles I have written. Each one has one or more categories, which are listed on the <a href="/categories">categories</a> page. Clicking a category on the categories page displays a page listing all the articles for that category.</p>

<p>October 2024.</p>
