<p><img class="float-image-left" src="/content/index/paul.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell" /></p>

<p>This is the website of Paul Chappell, I’m a 69-year-old retired computer programmer.</p>

<p>I’ll be writing about anything that interests me, absolutely  anything. However, my main interests are:</p>

<h3 id="photography">Photography</h3>

<p>I’ve been a keen photographer all my life.</p>

<p>It all started when I was at university in the mid-seventies. In those days there were no digital cameras, it was all film. In my study, I have a large box of slides and prints. I’m hoping to digitise some of them, in order to show them on this website (though there are issues doing this, see <a href="/photography/digitising-old-slides-negatives-and-prints">this web page</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007 I bought a digital SLR. It’s getting very old now, but it still works. I’m hoping to replace it later this year. I also use my mobile phone. For photo editing I use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, it’s open source and free.</p>

<p><img class="float-image-right" src="/content/index/paul-edge-hill.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell at Edge Hill Station in 1977" /></p>

<p>The photograph of me on the right was taken by my friend John Buckley at Edge Hill railway station, in 1977.</p>

<h3 id="science-and-technology">Science and Technology</h3>

<p>I’ve always been interested in science, maths and engineering.</p>

<p>Back in the early/mid-seventies I did a civil engineering degree. I never became a civil engineer; I decided computer programming was much more interesting. The one thing I did learn on the course was how buildings are designed and built. For some reason, I’ve always loved big bridges.</p>

<p>The course taught me a lot about maths, most of it I’ve forgotten, but I really liked maths (somebody has to).</p>

<p>I may write about computers and the internet on this website, but not about programming (I don’t want to put people off). I’ve another website dedicated to programming websites, it’s <a href="http://jekyllwebsites.retirednotout.uk/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>

<p>I’ve been lucky to travel abroad a lot in the past, but nowadays its mostly local. Around West Yorkshire and Merseyside. I’ll be writing about my travels.</p>

<p>I’ve been a member of the <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">Campaign for Real Ale</a> for over 50 years! I’ll be writing about some of the more interesting pubs I visit. Like the <a href="https://theshipandmitre.uk/">Ship and Mitre</a> Liverpool, one of my favourites.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-website-is-structured">How This Website is Structured</h2>

<p>This needs to be written - the actual structure of this website has not been decided yet. It’s early days in this project.</p>
