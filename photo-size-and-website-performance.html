<p><span class="whoandwhen">Published by Paul Chappell 30th December 2023</span></p>

<p>The first photo at the bottom of this page is the original, its size is 4,324,798 bytes, a big, big file. When the browser first displays the photo, it needs to download it from the web server. If you are working at home using a giga-bit link, the size is not a problem. If you are using a mobile phone over 4G, the size might (or probably will) be a problem.</p>

<p>If a post that has several photos, such as <a href="https://retirednotout.uk/photos-of-kirkcudbright-harbour-scotland-in-august-2022">this one</a>, then the total size of the photos can become considerable. It has 12 photos. If each one has a size of 4 million bytes, then the total download size is 48 million bytes. Which will take some time on a slow link. It also uses a lot of bandwidth on a mobile phone.</p>

<p>If you are using jpegs, you can reduce the quality of the photo. Using gimp (‘export as’ under the file menu) I reduced the quality of the original, to 20% (when you reduce the quality do not overwrite the original). The photo size reduces to 469,576 bytes, a big saving. The second photo below is the reduced quality one. It looks just as good.</p>

<p>Sometimes, 20% might be too much of a reduction, it’s probably best to experiment with different qualities.</p>

<p>Some people steal photos from a website, if your photos are low quality, it restricts what they can do with them.</p>

<p>You can also think about how you want people to see a photo. The third photo below, shows the original cropped with a quality of 20%. The size is now 210,851 bytes.</p>

<p>If you are using someone else’s photos (or any material) you need to prove they own the photo or they have permission to publish it on your website. Several years ago, I came across a website developer who was fined several thousand pounds for using copyrighted photos. The person the site was for had lifted photos from one of the sites that sells them, such as Alamy or Getty Images. The developer did not check for permission to use the photos and was fined. So, if you use other people’s material, make sure they have permission to use it.</p>

<p>The original photo:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/12/psawp/original.jpg" alt="Original photo" class="img-landscape" /></p>

<p>The photo saved with 20% quality:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/12/psawp/original-20-percent.jpg" alt="Original photo" class="img-landscape" /></p>

<p>The photo  cropped and saved with 20% quality:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023/12/psawp/original-20-percent-cropped.jpg" alt="Original photo" class="img-landscape" /></p>
