# A Holiday in Kirkcudbright, Summer 2022

In the summer of 2022, I went on holiday with my wife, mother and sister to Kirkcudbright. 

We chose Kirkcudbright because of this [post](https://www.packthesuitcases.com/things-to-do-in-kirkcudbright-artists-town-scotland/){:target="_blank"} on the *Pack the Suitcases* blog (a very interesting travel blog, well written and well worth reading). She describes the town a lot better than I can.

Parking in the town was free. This is good because people can pop into town to do a little shopping and don't have to worry about parking. 

It's a nice place to wander around, lots of art galleries and an interesting harbour.

One thing I liked about the town was the shops, not for the shopping (my wife and I hate shopping) but because of the total lack of chain stores. I always feel that I'm in an interesting place when I don't recognise the high street shops.

For drinks we used the [Masonic Arms](https://www.masonic-arms.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}. We had several enjoyable sessions there. The beer was always excellent; the pub has been in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide for several years. 

One thing that did disappoint us was that we could not find a restaurant that interested us. Though this was not a problem as we had access to a kitchen to cook our own food.

Apart from the photos I took of the Harbour, most are of poor quality, and cannot be published on this website. The photos I took of the harbour are [here](/blog/kirkcudbright-harbour-scotland-2022).

On one of the days, we drove along the coast visiting various towns. I took [these photos](/blog/garlieston-harbour-scotland-2022) of Garlieston Harbour; and [these photos](/blog/isle-of-whithorn-harbour-scotland-2022) of the Isle of Whithorn harbour.
