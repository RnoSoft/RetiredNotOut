Today I went for a boat ride on the [Waverley](https://waverleyexcursions.co.uk/shop/){:target="_blank"}, the world's last seagoing paddle steamer (pictured above, photo courtesy of my cousin Alan Clague). It was from the Seacombe landing stage on the Mersey to the pier at Llandudno  and back. What was surprising about the trip was how far out into the Irish Sea we went, about 12 miles of the coast. I expected us to closely follow it, giving good views of it.

The rest of this post is about why we had to go out so far. It will refer to this map of the [Mersey Estuary](https://webapp.navionics.com/#boating@9&key=akjeId~wR){:target="_blank"}.

To be completed.
