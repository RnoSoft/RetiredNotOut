I've just been for a walk around  the village and took the following photos.

As you can see, it was very misty. They were taken with my new toy, a [Panasonic Lumix FZ2000](https://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/cameras-camcorders/lumix-digital-cameras/bridge-cameras/dmc-fz2000.html){:target="_blank"} camera. I'm trying to learn how to use this complicated machine.

Until I acquired it, it would have been difficult to take any of the photographs above without a tripod, it was too dark. The camera has up to four and half stops of image stabilisation. Which means I can sometimes get away with hand holding the camera in poor lighting conditions.

The only processing I have done on the photos is to crop some of them to make them more interesting, I've also needed to correct the verticals on a few. I have not adjusted the colour balance of any of them, the colours are as they came out of the camera.
