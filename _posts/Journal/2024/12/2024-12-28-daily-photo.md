![Wallace Monument Stirling]

Today's photo is a view across the rooftops of Stirling, towards the Wallace Monument. It was taken just up the road from the [Settle Inn](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/settle-inn-stirling-168471){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The pub is excellent (with a roaring fire when we went), it's in the Good Beer Guide and is Stirling’s oldest pub. Well worth a visit.

My wife and I spent three days there just before Christmas. The weather was not very good to us (an understatement). It was not good for photography, so unfortunately, I didn't get many photos.

A mention in dispatches for [Nicky Tam's Bar and Bothy](https://nickytams.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Curly Coo](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/curly-coo-stirling-168481){:target="_blank"} and the [Mint Leaf Curry House](https://mintleafstirling.com/reservations/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. If you decide to go to Bridge of Allan, the Bridge of Allan brewhouse is seriously damaging for your wealth. A 3.8% bitter cost £6.50, the other real ales cost £7 (all the real ales are brewed at the pub).
