![The Ferry Tavern, Penketh]

After a fast, non-stop, four-hour drive south from Stirling, I was in dire need of a bevvy. A quick look in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide found [The Ferry Tavern](https://www.theferrytavern.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The pint I had was excellent and the pub was a very pleasant place to sit and rest. It does not do food, except for pies.

The pub has a large beer garden, where you can sit enjoying the view of the river and the countryside. I think I'll be back there some time in the summer.

It's a very, very difficult pub to get to, we had to ask directions a few times (maybe I need a sat nav). Eventually you drive down station road (the [station](http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/f/fidler%27s_ferry_&_penketh/index.shtml){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} is long gone). There is a car park on the left, just before the level crossing. Once parked, you cross the railway and the canal. The pub is down by the river on the right.

If you are fit enough you could walk along the [Sankey Canal](https://www.sankeycanal.co.uk/about-sankey-canal){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} towpath from Widnes to Warrington. It's also close to the [Trans Pennine Trail](https://www.transpenninetrail.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. There is a local bus, but it's a long walk from the bus stop.
