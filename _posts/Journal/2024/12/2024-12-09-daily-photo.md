![The bar of the Sportsman Pub, Huddersfield]

This is one of my favourite pubs in Huddersfield. 

It's a previous winner of the CAMRA/English Heritage Conservation Pub Design award. The main room has a curved central bar, a parquet wood floor, an interesting wooden entrance and some fine windows. An Art Deco pub. Before it's refit it was a pub you would avoid, a pub destined to be closed.

It's owned by [Beerhouses](https://beerhouses.co.uk/the-sportsman/){:target="_blank"}. Two more of their pubs are well worth a visit, the [Stalybridge Buffer Bar](https://beerhouses.co.uk/stalybridge-buffet-bar/){:target="_blank"} on Stalybridge station, and the [West Riding](https://beerhouses.co.uk/the-west-riding/){:target="_blank"} on Dewsbury station.

A much better place to visit than yesterday's cafe.
