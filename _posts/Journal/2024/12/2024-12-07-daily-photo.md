![Canal view in Bergues, Northern France]

It's been a dark and gloomy week here in Marsden, so here's a summer photo of one of the canals in Bergues, Northern France.

It's a lovely little town well worth a visit for a night or two. Nothing special, just a pleasant place. A place to just wander around, following the canals. The ramparts are well worth a look. There's a large belfry  or Carilion, in the centre of town. It has 50 bells, which sound for the Monday market and special festivals. It's easy to get there, just down the motorway from Dunkirk, on the way from Calais to/from Brugge.

It is where [Welcome to the Sticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome-to_the_Sticks){:target="_blank"} was filmed. Which is a very, very funny film about a French Postmaster who must move from the South of France to the North. Well worth watching, but if you don't speak French, you need a copy of the film with English Subtitles.

As you have probably noticed, there has been no daily photos for the last six days. I've been doing major surgery to this website, which made it difficult to add them.
