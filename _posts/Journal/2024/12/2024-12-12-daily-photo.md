![Steam train entering Porthmadog station]

I published a similar photo to this one, on [October the 7th](/blog/daily-photo-2024-10-07). It shows a steam train entering Porthmadog station, and the fireman handing over the single line token to the signal man. Today, I decided to publish a slightly different photo.

To stop two trains running on the same single section of line, it is protected by a single line token. A train can only proceed along a section of single line if it has the token. When entering such a section, the train driver or fireman needs to obtain the token. On leaving the token needs to be handed back to the signal man.
