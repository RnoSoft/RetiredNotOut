On our second day in Stirling, we decided to have a day out in Glasgow. The weather was terrible, dark heavy grey clouds, wind and lots of rain. So again, very few photos, we just got wet and visited some excellent  pubs.

Just after midday we ended up in the [Scotia bar](https://www.belhaven.co.uk/pubs/glasgow/scotia-bar){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, one of Glasgow's oldest. It has a historic interior. It's well worth a visit, and often has live music. Take care approaching the pub from Howard Street, you will see a door and sign advertising the Scotia Pool Hall. We almost turned round there and then. But luckily, we went round the corner and found the bar. The pool hall is upstairs, totally separate from the pub.

The rest of the day was spent walking around Glasgow visiting a few more excellent pubs. These two are in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide, [Pot Still](https://thepotstill.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and the [Laurieston Bar](https://whatpub.com/pubs/GLA/0750/laurieston-bar-glasgow){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The Pot Still is a well-known whisky bar. The Laurieston has a historic interior.

We also had an excellent curry in the [Village Curry House](https://www.villagecurry-house.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, just down from the Laurieston. One of the best we've had in a long time.

The Laurieston and the Village Curry House are close to Bridge Street station on the Glasgow Subway. We caught the train from Stirling, there are lots of them and an off-peak return is £10.40. In my eyes, Stirling is a much better place to stay, even in the rain!

There's an extra photo today, it shows the inside of the Scotia.
