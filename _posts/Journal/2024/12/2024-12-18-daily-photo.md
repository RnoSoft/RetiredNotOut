![Canal towpath at lock 31E]

The photo shows the Huddersfield Narrow Canal towpath at lock 31E, looking towards Huddersfield.

The lady with the purple anorak was collecting litter left on the towpath. It's a real shame that people walking along the canal cannot take their litter with them.

It's part of a series of photos taken during a walk on a sunny day at the end of October, the series starts [here](/blog/daily-photo-2024-12-13).
