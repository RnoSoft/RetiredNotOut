![Lock 32E looking towards Marsden]

Just past the footbridge is the next lock on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, 32E. 

On the right is Sparth Reservoir, reached by a path from the other side of the lock. Unfortunately, when I was there, they were working on the reservoir, as can be seen by the yellow fence, so I couldn't get to it. It's a small reservoir that feeds the canal. It's also used for water sports, such as canoeing and swimming. I've even seen people swimming there in frosty weather (not for me).

This photo is part of a series of photos taken during a walk on a sunny day at the end of October, the series starts [here](/blog/daily-photo-2024-12-13).
