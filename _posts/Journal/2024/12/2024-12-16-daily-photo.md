![Sun shining through some trees]

The photo was taken from the footpath, while I was walking from the Olive Branch Inn down to the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. 

It's part of a series of photographs taken during a walk along the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, on a sunny day at the end of October, the series starts [here](/blog/daily-photo-2024-12-13).
