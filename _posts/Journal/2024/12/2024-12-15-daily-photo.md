![The Olive Branch inn, Marsden]

I'm told the [Olive Branch](https://www.olivebranch.uk.com/index.html) has excellent food and sells real ale. In all my years living here it's a place I've never managed to visit. Though I've walked past it often enough.

The footpath to the Huddersfield Narrow Canal starts at the bottom of the car park. Follow the path to the trees, through the trees, across the river and up to the canal.

The photo is part of a series of photographs taken during a walk along the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, on a sunny day at the end of October, the series starts [here](/blog/daily-photo-2024-12-13).
