![Dean Clough, Halifax Lego Model]

Last week, I visited [Dean Clough](https://www.deanclough.com/visit/){:target="_blank"}, Halifax. I had a wander around the galleries, mainly looking at the photos. In one of the rooms, I came across a model of Dean Clough constructed entirely out of Lego. It's amazing. Apparently, it's got over a million pieces of Lego in it. The galleries are free to visit, well worth it.

I took a couple of photos of the model. I'm not happy with either, but one of them is shown above. It needs some corrections, mainly the colour balance and the perspective. Over the next few months, I'm going to learn how to fix them, in order to produce a better-looking photo, which I will eventually publish as a daily photo (I'll link to it from here). I use [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/){:target="_blank"} for photo editing (open-source and free, though donations are welcome), and I'm an absolute beginner. 

Dean Clough is an easy walk out of Halifax.

While wandering around I came across the tap room for the [Stod Fold Brewery](https://stodfolddeanclough.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}. Unfortunately (or may be fortunately) it was closed, but it looks like an excellent place to have a beer after visiting the galleries. It's in Camra's Good Beer guide, so I guess I am going to have to return.

**Update 9th May 2025:** the photo will not be corrected and will remain as it is. I had the wrong setting on my camera, if I'd used the correct setting for the white balance all would have been OK.
