![Lock 39E]

I've taken this photo in all sorts of weather. This one was taken on a sunny autumnal day, when the leaves were turning brown and starting to fall. It shows the view from Lock 39E on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, looking towards the Standedge tunnel.

It's part of a series of photos taken during a walk on a sunny day at the end of October, the series starts [here](/blog/daily-photo-2024-12-13).

It is the last one of this series. Hopefully, we will soon have a bright frosty day, so I can continue along the canal towards the Standedge Tunnel, taking another sequence of photos. When I publish the sequence, I'll link to it from this page.
