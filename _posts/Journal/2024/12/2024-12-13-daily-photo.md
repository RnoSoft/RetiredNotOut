![Daily Walk, Country Road]

For the next couple of weeks, I'm going to publish a series of photos taken during a walk along the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, in late October. It starts at the Oliva Branch Inn, Marsden. There's a path from the bottom of the car park, down to the canal. You then follow the canal towpath back to Marsden.

It was a bright sunny autumnal day, and it was still warm. The Leaves where changing colour and falling from the trees. There were still narrow boats on the canal. 

The above photo was taken during the walk from where I live, to the Olive Branch.

Recently, the weather here in Marsden has mostly been dark and cloudy. And even on those rare days when we get the sun, it's very low in the sky. Which is why I am showing these pictures.
