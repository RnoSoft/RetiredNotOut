![The beer shack Micro Pub, Clitheroe]

This photo was taken on a grey cloudy day, during a visit to Clitheroe with my sister and friend John. It's not a fantastic photo; it's included here so I can write about another pub we visited there. 

[Yesterday's photo](/blog/daily-photo-2024-11-16) was of the Bowland Beer Hall. It was the second pub we visited; this was the first. It's a lot, lot smaller (only 4 handpumps), but in my humble opinion, it's a lot, lot better. A plus point is that it is very close to the station. Important, as the trains only run once an hour! We should have finished here.

It's a small micro pub in a converted shop, with its own brewery. And seems to have a decent selection of bottled beers. Their website is [here](https://thebeershack.uk/){:target="_blank"}.

There is another micro pub mentioned in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide, [The Ale House](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/ale-house-clitheroe-176202){:target="_blank"}, it's just round the corner from the Beer Shack. We didn't visit it, because it was closed. It's another micro pub, so it's almost certainly well worth a visit.
