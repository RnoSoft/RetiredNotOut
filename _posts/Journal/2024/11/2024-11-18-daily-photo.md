![The Liver building Liverpool, taken from the Albert Dock]

Taken from the Albert Dock.

It was taken in early October, just after [this photo](/blog/daily-photo-2024-10-11). I was walking around the Pier Head/Albert dock area trying out my new camera. Over the next couple of days, I'll be showing a few more photos of the Liver building, that I took during that walk.
