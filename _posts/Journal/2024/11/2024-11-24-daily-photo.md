![Albert Dock, Liverpool]

This photo was taken on a cloudy day during a visit to Liverpool in early October. I was walking along the waterfront from the Pier Head to the Albert Dock. Several of my recent daily photos were taken on that walk, including the ones of the Liver Building.

Further information on the Albert Dock can be found [here](https://albertdock.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Dock,_Liverpool){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

It's a complex of dock buildings, opened in 1846 and finally closed in 1972. It then remained derelict for almost ten years. During that time there was a big debate about what to do with it. A lot of people in power wanted to demolish it, someone even suggested building a tower block there. Luckily sense prevailed, the buildings where renovated and it became a public attraction. It's well worth a visit.

If you are thirsty after you visit, I suggest the [Baltic Fleet](https://www.balticfleet.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} pub, just down the road. It's in Camra's Good Beer guide and the real ale is excellent.
