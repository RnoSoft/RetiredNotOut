![The Isle of Man Ferry with Liverpool in the background]

It was taken from the prom in New Brighton, you can just see the Isle of Man Ferry approaching the dock.

There is a lovely walk from the Seacombe Ferry Terminal, along the prom, to New Brighton. It's a couple of miles and is well worth it. When you reach New Brighton, the [Bow Legged Beagle](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/bow-legged-beagle-new-brighton-132235){:target="_blank"} is worth visiting  for a few well-earned bevvies. During the week you could do the walk in reverse and catch a late afternoon commuter ferry from Seacombe to the Pier Head. Ferry across the Mersey!

The iron railings run all the way from Seacombe to New Brighton.
