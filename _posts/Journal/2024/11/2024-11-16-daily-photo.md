![The Bowland Beer Hall, Clitheroe]

I visited this pub in early November, with my sister and friend John. It's the brewery tap of the [Bowland Brewery](https://www.bowlandbrewery.com/){:target="_blank"}, and seems to sell all their  beers plus many guests. At 106 feet long, it has the second longest bar in the country. The are 42 handpumps selling real ales, including all the breweries and many guest beers from around the country. It's in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide. Their website is [here](https://www.jamesplaces.com/holmes-mill/bowland-beer-hall/){:target="_blank"}.

It's a short walk from the town centre along Moor Lane. It serves food, but I'd recommend the Castle Chippy, it's on the way back to town.

Clitheroe is a lovely place to visit, well worth a day out.
