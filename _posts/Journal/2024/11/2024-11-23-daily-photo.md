![St Johns Beacon, Liverpool]

This tower is well known in Liverpool. It was completed in 1969 when the St Johns market was redeveloped. It's now home to Radio City and has an observation deck, giving superb views across Liverpool and the River Mersey. 

Further information is available [here](https://stjohnsbeacon.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Johns_Beacon){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

The photo was taken with my new Panasonic Lumix camera, with the zoom set to 480mm and no tripod. Thanks to the camera's image stabilization there is little camera shake. Until image stabilization appeared in cameras, I would have to have used a tripod to get the shot.
