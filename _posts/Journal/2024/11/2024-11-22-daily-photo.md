Cruise ship moored at the Pier Head Liverpool, in June 2021.

Today there is still snow on the ground. I've just been out for a walk hoping to take some photos, but it was too slippery for a 69-year-old, so I hardly took any. I didn't want to slip and break myself or the camera. If you are interested in snowy pictures of Marsden, see this [post](https://retirednotout.uk/blog/marsden-winter-snow-2009-2010).

Going with my recent theme of pictures of the Liver Building in Liverpool, here's another one.
