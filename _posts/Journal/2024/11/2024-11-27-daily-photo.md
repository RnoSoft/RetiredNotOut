In the background you can see the Seaforth Dock container port.

The photos were  taken with my old camera on a cloudy July day back in 2021. I wanted to go the previous day, which was very sunny, but the temperatures were in the upper 20's, far too hot for me. On the actual day it was much cooler, but the conditions were not great for photography. Still, they do show people on the beach, on the banks of the River Mersey, having fun.

There were a few people swimming in the river. It's a lot cleaner now than it was in the late 50's, when I was there as child (one of my very early memories). Looking at the internet, there are people who swim in it to keep fit. There is even an [annual swim across the Mersey](https://www.theforshawgroup.com/2021/09/the-across-mersey-swim-28-years-of-adventure-swimming/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I'll be there next year, just to take some photos.

I have several possible photos to use, and I couldn't decide on which one, so as a bonus today, here are other two:
