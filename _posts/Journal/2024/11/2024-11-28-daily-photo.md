![The Isle of Man Ferry passing Everton's new statium]

Over the next two days I'm publishing more photos of the Isle of Man Ferry approaching its terminus in Liverpool. They were all taken with my new Panasonic Lumix camera, from the New Brighton Prom, at a high zoom level. Interesting photos since they show what is possible with a camera that has decent image stabilization and a very long lens.

This one shows the Isle of Man ferry passing Everton football club's new stadium.
