![Liverpool, taken from New Brighton]

I visited New Brighton with my friend John, during a visit to Liverpool last October. We took several photo's on the prom, and then retired to the [Bow Legged Beagle](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/bow-legged-beagle-new-brighton-132235){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for a few bevvies. It's a micro-pub with excellent real ale and a good selection of bottled beers. They have their [own website](https://www.thebowleggedbeagle.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, but beware, the opening times seem to be incorrect. It's not in Camra's Good Beer Guide, it should be.

As you can see, there are not a lot of people on the beach. Back in 2021, I was there in the summer, the tide was out and there were a lot of people having fun on the beach. Tomorrow, I'll publish one of the pictures taken back then.

I was born in Liverpool and have an early memory of playing on the beach there, sometime in the late 1950's. Back in those days, there was a pier and a ferry service to and from Liverpool. The ferry stopped in 1971, in 1972 the pier was declared dangerous due to corrosion and was demolished in 1978.

A walk along the prom is well worth it. It starts with views across the River Mersey, then views out to the Irish Sea (or vice-versa). It's easy to get there, by bus or train from Liverpool.
