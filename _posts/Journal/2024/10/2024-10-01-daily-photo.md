![The road from the mainland to Holy Island](/content/blog/2024/10/day-photo-01.jpg){:class="image-landscape"}

Today's photo is the road from the mainland to Holy Island (Lindisfarne) in Northumbria.

This was taken back in December 2007 and was one the first I every took with my Canon EOS 400D. We were driving home from Berwick Upon Tweed, along the Northumberland coast. I was hoping to get onto Holy Island, but as you can see, the causeway was flooded. It was a bright sunny day.
