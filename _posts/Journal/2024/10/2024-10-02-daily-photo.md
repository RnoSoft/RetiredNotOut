![Rare King George post-box, at Llanrhaeadr Ym Mochnant (Wales)](/content/blog/2024/10/day-photo-02.jpg){:class="image-portrait"}

Today's photo is of a very rare GR (King George) post-box, seen at the Llanrhaeadr Ym Mochnant (Wales) Post Office. It is from my archive and was taken back in April 2008.
