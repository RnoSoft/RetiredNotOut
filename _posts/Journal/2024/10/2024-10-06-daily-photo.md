![Drummer at the Marsden Jazz Festival, 2008](/content/blog/2024/10/day-photo-06.jpg){:class="image-landscape"}

It was taken at the Liberal Club, during the 2008 Marsden Jazz Festival.

I've never had much success taking photos of bands performing. The problem is the lack of light (a flash just doesn't work) and getting the expressions on people’s faces right. The timing of the shot is very, very important, especially as there is a slight delay between pressing the shutter release and the picture being taken.
