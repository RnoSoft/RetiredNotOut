Today was also wet and horrible, my wife and I drove from Porthmadog to Liverpool in the rain, not good. 

We then went to the pub, a new one for us, the Liverpool Brewing Company Tap. It's on Lime Street almost opposite the Adelphi Hotel. It's in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide (2025 Edition). The beer was excellent and well-priced. It is now one of our firm favourites. Further details on CAMRA's What Pub website.

**Update 2nd May 2025**, the Liverpool Brewing Company went into administration  last February. I haven't visited the pub since then, so it might not be as good as it was. The other problem I had with the pub is that it became a bit pricy, it was costing almost £5.00 for a pint. Though I did get a CAMRA discount, which helped.
