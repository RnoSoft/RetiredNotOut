![View over Marsden from Stubbin Road]

My wife loves black and white photos. So, the other week I started looking at producing them.

The above photo is the first one I took with my new camera.

The first idea was to use [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/){:target="_blank"}, to convert some of my colour photos to black and white. It's easier said than done. There are a huge number of options, a real learning curve. I'm a bit busy at the moment, so not a realistic option.

So, last week I went out for one of my favourite walks, I set the camera to black and white mode and took some photos. I'll be publishing some of them over the next few days.
