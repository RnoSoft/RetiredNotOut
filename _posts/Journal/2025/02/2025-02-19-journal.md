![A night shot of Carrs Road Marsden]

Last night I took several photos outside my house, this was one of the better ones. It was the first time I used my new camera for night shots, with my tripod. Hopefully, future photos will get better, I've a lot to learn. But it's a start.

Tomorrow I'm off to Liverpool to look after my 96-year mum while my sister goes to Iceland.

There will be no journal entries until I get back. Then, there should be quite a few showing photos taken in Liverpool. Including some night shots of the Pier Head.
