![My sisters cat, Cleo]

The photo was taken while in Liverpool, looking after my mother. My sister was on holiday in Iceland. Virtually every photo I have taken of her cat has been rubbish, for some reason, this one works.

I'm not great at taking photos of animals and people, I prefer landscapes.
