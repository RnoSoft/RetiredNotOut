![Black and white photo of the new mill Marsden]

The photo was taken on a cloudy day the other week.

The Mill has been unused for over 20 years and desperately needs to be re-developed. [This website](https://www.newmillsmarsden-consultation.co.uk/) contains information about the planned re-development. 

I'll be taking a lot more photos of the old mill, as a record of what it looked like before being re-developed.
