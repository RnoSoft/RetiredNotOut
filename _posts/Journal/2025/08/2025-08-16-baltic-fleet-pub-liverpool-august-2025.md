![The baltic fleet pub]

I've been visiting this [pub](https://www.balticfleet.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} since the early eighties.

The beer has always been excellent (it's a regular in the Good Beer Guide), but it can be a little pricy (it's close to the Royal Albert Dock). But be warned, at present it only takes cards, sadly no cash.

The building is grade II listed and has a distinctive flat iron shape.

It's a difficult pub to get to due to a lack of buses. If you are leaving the pub, the 500 bus will take you into town (the bus stop is almost opposite it). Sadly, the bus does not go past the pub on its way out of town. If you are going to the pub, you can have a pleasant walk through the Albert Dock area on the way there.
