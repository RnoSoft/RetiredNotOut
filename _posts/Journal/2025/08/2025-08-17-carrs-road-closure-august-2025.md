![Council notice telling us that Carrs Road will be closed for road works.]

About ten days ago a council notice appeared on the lamp post opposite our house. It told us that our road would be closed from, and I quote, *from its junction with Rose Mount Street, to its junction with May Deane*. This caused some confusion; nobody has heard of Rose Mount Street or May Deane.

I asked one of our counsellors (apparently, we need three) about this, she sent me a copy of the original closure request. It said the local water company wanted to close the road between Rose Mount and May Dene (note the different spelling) in order to fix the sewer. With this information, a bit of research shows that Rose Mount and May Dene are house names and **not street names**.  Streets with these names do not exist.

No wonder we couldn’t find the location of the closure. 

The notice was written by the local council’s **legal department**. That's very, very worrying. Questions have been asked.

## Update 12th October 2025

Questions have not been answered (I don't expect them to be).

The closure was supposed to be from the 18th to the 22nd of August. Today it's the 12th of October, the sewer hasn't been fixed yet.

Mind you, the notice says the closure order remains in effect for eighteen months. So, the water company has another 16 months available for digging up the road! When they come, we'll probably have forgotten about the closure.

It's also a bit worrying that Yorkshire Water have found a problem with the sewer in our road but don't seem to be interested in actually fixing it.
