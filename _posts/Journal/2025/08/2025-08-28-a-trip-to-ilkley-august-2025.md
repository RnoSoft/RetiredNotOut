Today my wife and I went to Ilkley, for a look around and a drink.

A while ago I'd read in a paper that it was an interesting place with a lot of independent shops.  That's certainly true, but I found it to be a bit of a letdown. It also started raining while we were there, which didn't help. Still, it was a day out. I probably won't be visiting again.

Before our trip I had a look in my trusty good beer guide, there is just one pub, the [Flying Duck](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/flying-duck-ilkley-126297){:target="_blank"}. It was a pleasant enough place, home of the Wharfedale Brewery. But the beer is a bit expensive, the Best Bitter was £4.60. But then, Ilkley is very up market.

On the way there we called in at [Salts Mill](https://www.saltsmill.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}. We were last there over ten years ago, and it seems to have gone downhill. We seem to remember a room full of old mill machinery, which has disappeared. Shame, it was very interesting. There were a lot of paintings on show, including a gallery with works by David Hockney. Lots of shopping opportunities and a restaurant/bar.
