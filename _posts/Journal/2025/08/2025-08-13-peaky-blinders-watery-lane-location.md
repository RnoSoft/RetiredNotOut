My wife and I are big fans of [Peaky Blinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)){:target="_blank"}, a drama set in industrial Birmingham back in the 1920's. It's now showing on Netflix and is well worth watching.

If you've seen the TV series, you will be well aware of what Watery Lane looks like. It's the road that contains the Garrison Pub.

If not, Google *Peaky Blinders Watery Lane* to find photos of what the street looks like in the series (or better still, watch the series). 

The actual filming location was Powis Street in Liverpool, the two photos on this page show the street as it looked today. Clearly there has been a massive amount of CGI in the film version of the street.

While filming the series the street and other local streets were pretty rundown. After filming a lot of money was spent on the area.
