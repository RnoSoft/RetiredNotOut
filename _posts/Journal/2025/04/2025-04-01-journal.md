![Boats on the Sanket canal.]

Another good day today, the three cold months are now over, we are now entering April. And it's going to be a warm week. And the leaves are starting to grow on the trees, they are starting to turn green. The country is finally coming back to life.

Today's photo was taken a bit further along the canal from yesterdays and shows two larger boats, both in a state of disrepair.

When we were there, we had a chat to someone working on the first one, doing it up. He said the canal here is a lovely quiet place. Behind the boats there is a railway, a goods line running from Widnes to Warrington. He told us there is current only one train a day along it, now that the Fiddlers Ferry power station is closed. He also told us that there is a plan to build 10,000 houses on the old power station site, and to convert the railway to a road, linking the estate to Warrington. Hopefully the road will not be built, as it will destroy the peace and quiet of this lovely place.

He currently lives in a flat in the centre of Liverpool, his boat has more floor space than the flat! I got the impression that he was doing it up to live on it, but I forgot to ask him. 

I'm currently reading the travel books of two of my favourite travel writers: [Paul Theroux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul-Theroux) and [Bill Bryson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill-Bryson). I'm going to have to start thinking like them, they'd have asked him if he was going to live there. Mind you, when I spoke to him, I didn't know I'd be writing this page!
