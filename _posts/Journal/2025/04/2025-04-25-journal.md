![Cars on the high street in Bishops Castle.]

Something else that gets in the way is cars.

The above photo is of the High Street, Bishops Castle, looking towards the town hall. Its full of cars. Because of the cars, I never got a decent photo of the town hall.

We all need to park when we are out and about in our cars. We will always need on street parking, and the cars will always get in way of photography. That's a fact.

However, we need to have more pedestrianised areas, in the centre of our towns and villages, such as the road leading up to the town hall in the above photo. If we have pedestrianised areas, we can have seats outside the bars and cafes, like the continentals do. Benches to sit on. Flowers and trees. It becomes a place for people, rather than cars.

I came across this [article](https://harrogatebid.co.uk/pedestrianisation-the-pros-and-cons-and-how-it-has-been-used-in-other-areas/) while writing this post. It explains some of the pros and cons of pedestrianisation.
