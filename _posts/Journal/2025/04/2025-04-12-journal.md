![Bank Bottom mill from Butterly reservoir]

Today is yet another warm sunny day here in Marsden, it's been warm and sunny for the last two weeks or so. The last time the weather was like this in April was 2003, that year we had an excellent summer. So, fingers crossed for this Summer, we're in desperate need of a good one.

I've just been for a walk round the Butterly Reservoir dam.

The photo on this page was taken during that work and shows of one of the two remaining mills in Marsden, Bank Bottom. It closed in 2003, the year I moved here and has been unused ever since. It's about time the mill was converted into flats. It must never be demolished; it's part of our heritage.
