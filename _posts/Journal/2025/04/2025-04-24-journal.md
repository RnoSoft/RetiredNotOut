![Telegraph pole in Marsden.]

There are many things that can get in the way of a good photo, one of them is telephone wires.

The above photo was taken at the front of our house and shows the telegraph pole opposite. Recently we have had fibre to the house installed all over our village, this almost quadrupled the number of wires attached to the pole. This has happened all over Marsden.
