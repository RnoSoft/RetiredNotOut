![Reflections on the Huddersfield Narrow canal.]

This photo was taken a few days ago and shows the canal looking towards lock 31E. Most of the trees are still leafless, but some are starting to turn green. 

Today twenty years ago I married my wife Polly at the Dewsbury Registry Office. Or maybe not, when we got back from our honeymoon there was a letter from them asking us to bring the wedding certificate in as they had forgotten to sign it!

We picked Dewsbury Registry Office because it was a lovely old building, full of ornate woodwork. Last week I got the train there hoping to get some photos of it. Unfortunately, it is now closed. The building is boarded up and starting to decay. Bad news.
