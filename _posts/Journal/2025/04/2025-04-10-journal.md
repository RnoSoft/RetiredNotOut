![View from Pennines towards Saddleworth.]

Yesterday we had a lot of work done on the house, which resulted in a lot of noise. Cementing the flagstones in the gynnel and removing the last part of the lean to, the lead. I'm very sensitive to noise so I decided to go over to Uppermill for a haircut.

On the way there I stopped at the car park near the Pennine Way and Burnclough reservoir, at the top of the A62. Hoping to get some photos of the views. I only got one, the one above. It was bitterly cold with an eastern wind.
