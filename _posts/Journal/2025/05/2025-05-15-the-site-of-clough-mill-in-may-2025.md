![The site of the old Clough Mill.]

This photo was taken from almost the same location as the one on the 13th of May, though it was taken at a much wider angle. The mill would have been to the left of the couple walking along the canal. It's a sad loss, I'm sure it could have been converted into flats.

This photo is part of a series of photos of the Clough Mill area of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, near Marsden. The series start [here](/journal/houses-near-clough-mill-on-huddersfield-narrow-canal-may-2025).
