![Window of the fox and goose hebden bridge.]

Today I caught the bus to Hebden Bridge to have a look around, take some photos and drink some real ale in two of the town's more interesting pubs. Over the next week. I'll be publishing more photos taken on the trip.

The photo shows the window of the [Fox and Goose](https://www.foxandgoose.org){:target="_blank"}, the first pub I visited.

The [local CAMRA branch](https://heavywoollen.camra.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} has awarded it numerous *pub of the year* awards. Recently, it gave it it's *cider pub of the year* award. You can enjoy your drink in the bar or one of the adjacent rooms. If the weather is nice you can sit in the garden, but be warned it's two, maybe three, flights of stairs above the bar! Hebden Bridge is very hilly. I had two pints of bitter, both around 4%, costing £3.80 and £4.20. Excellent value.

It's a proper *community owned* pub, run by the local community. [This article](https://camra.org.uk/community-pubs){:target="_blank"} on the Camra website explains them in more detail.

The other one was [Drink](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/drink-hebden-bridge-177495){:target="_blank"}, a micropub closer to the town centre. There's a large selection of bottled beers to drink in or take away. They usually have three real ales on tap; I had two pints of porter at £4.20 a pint. Again, excellent value.

A *micropub* is a very small, modern, one-room pub, serving no food other than snacks, and "based upon good ale and lively banter".  [This article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropub#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Micropub%20Association%2C%20an%20organisation%20set,electronic%20entertainment%20and%20dabbles%20in%20traditional%20pub%20snacks%22.){:target="_blank"} on the Wikipedia website explains them in more detail.

Over the years I've visited lots of community owned/micro pubs, and almost all of them have been well worth a visit. Whenever I go somewhere new, I start looking for them. [Camra's good beer guide](https://camra.org.uk/good-beer-guide?landing_style=good_beer_guide&sort=nearest){:target="_blank"} is great help.
