![New Bridge Across the Mersey One.]

Today, with my friend JB, I went to the canal/river front at Runcorn, near the old bridge across the River Mersey, to take some photos. 

The above photo shows the new road bridge across the river Mersey, connecting Widnes and Runcorn. Behind the bridge is the old coal fired Fiddlers Ferry power station (which is due to be knocked down; a housing estate will be built there). In the foreground is the Manchester ship canal. Between the wall and the bridge is the river Mersey at low tide. At the bottom of the page there is another photo of the bridge, showing more of it.

One of my many retirement projects is to photograph the river Mersey. Bit, by bit I'm acquiring photos of the river, taken from various vantage points along it. Ultimately, I'd like to display a map of the river on this website. On the map, there will be various markers. Clicking a marker will display photos taken at the location of the marker.

After taking loads of photo's we caught the bus (a 14X if you're interested) to Aigburth, Liverpool, for a session at the [Old Bank Alehouse](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/old-bank-alehouse-liverpool-165953){:target="_blank"}. The pub sells well priced real ales, they had Taylors Landlord on for £4 a pint, extremely good value for that beer. They also sell four bottles of various German Beers for £19, to drink in or take away.
