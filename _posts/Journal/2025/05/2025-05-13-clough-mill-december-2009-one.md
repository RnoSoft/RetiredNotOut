![Clough mill from the canal towpath just after lock 33E.]

This photo shows Clough Mill taken from the canal towpath a few hundred yards before yesterday's photo. It was taken on a dark frosty December morning with my old Canon camera.

The old pictures included in this sequence are not some of my best. Back in those days I used to try and correct the colour and tonal balance using a cheap monitor. I've included them in order to show what the old Clough Mill looked like.

This photo is part of a series of photos of the Clough Mill area of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, near Marsden. The series start [here](/journal/houses-near-clough-mill-on-huddersfield-narrow-canal-may-2025).
