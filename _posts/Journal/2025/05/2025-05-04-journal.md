![Rochdale canal at hebden bridge.]

This photo is another view along the canal in Hebden Bridge, taken on the 2nd of May during my walk around the town. 

I arrived at Hebden Bridge on a bus, got off it near the station, and then followed the canal through town. I left the canal at Hebble End so I could get to the [Fox and Goose](https://www.foxandgoose.org) pub for my first bevvy of the day. The walk along the canal is very pleasant.
