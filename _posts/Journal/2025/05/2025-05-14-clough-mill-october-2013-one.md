![Clough mill from lock 31E back in 2011.]

This photo shows the view from lock 31E on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, towards Clough Mill. The mill is just visible in the background.

In previous years someone had spent a lot of time planting daffodils around the lock, as seen above. Later that year, some waterways workers, cutting the grass, cut all the daffodils down. They did not return next year. People still talk about what happened.

As you walked from lock 31E towards Marsden, the mill increasingly dominated the view.

This photo is part of a series of photos of the Clough Mill area of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, near Marsden. The series start [here](/journal/houses-near-clough-mill-on-huddersfield-narrow-canal-may-2025).
