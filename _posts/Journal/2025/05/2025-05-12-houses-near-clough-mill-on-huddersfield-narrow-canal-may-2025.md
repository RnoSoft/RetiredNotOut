![Houses near Clough Mill]

Just along the canal from the previous day's photo, there is a group of several cottages, almost certainly built for some of the workers at the nearby Clough Mill. The mill is long gone but the cottages remain. Over the years I've taken many photos of these cottages, the one above is the latest and will almost certainly not be the last.

I don't know why Clough Mill was demolished and what is going to happen with the site. There have been a number of planning applications to build houses there. According to the Kirklees planning website, the last one was withdrawn back in March this year. So, the site is going to remain derelict for some time.

Over the next few days or so, I'll be publishing a few photos of the Mill before it was demolished.
