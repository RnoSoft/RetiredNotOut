![Liverpool from the Shorefields Nature Park.]

Today, John and I went to the [Shorefields Nature Park](https://newferryonline.org.uk/shorefields-nature-park){:target="_blank"} to get some photos of the River Mersey and Liverpool. As you can see from the above photo, it was dark and cloudy. There was also a strong wind, so we only stayed for half an hour.

It's easy to get there from central Liverpool, you get the 464 bus to the terminus (Pollitt Square). It takes about 45 minutes, and it goes through the [old Mersey Tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensway_Tunnel){:target="_blank"}. The upstairs front seats give a good view of the inside of the tunnel.

The photo shows a cruise liner moored at the Pier Head and the red cranes of Seaforth dock. It was taken at a high zoo, compressing the image; the cranes are more than two miles from the liner.

When you get to the river, there's a path, which is called the Wirral Circular Walk. If you turn right and follow it, you will soon get to the [Port Sunlight River Park](https://thelandtrust.org.uk/space/port-sunlight-river-park/){:target="_blank"}. It looks like another interesting place to visit, but we didn't due to the wind. Hopefully I'll get there on another of my visits to Liverpool. 

On the way to Shorefields, I saw a large sign advertising Thwaits Beers, on the side of what looked like a pub. I thought, I bet that's the [Rose and Crown](https://www.roseandcrownbebington.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} Bebington, a pub I used to frequent in the late seventies and early eighties. On the way back, we decided to chance it and got off the bus nearby. It turned out that it was. We spent a pleasant three/four hours there drinking the excellent Thwaites Original bitter. The beer was excellent, as you would expect from a Camra Good Beer Guide pub.
