Today I returned home; I took no photos.

So, I've published another one taken yesterday at Shorefields. It shows the cruise liner and the Liverpool waterfront. This time, at a much lower zoom level.

Because I'm getting tired of driving, I used the train for this trip, buying an open return, which allows me to have a break of journey along the route. I broke my journey home at Stalybridge so I could have a pint at the excellent [Station Buffet Bar](https://beerhouses.co.uk/stalybridge-buffet-bar/){:target="_blank"}. It's in the Good Beer Guide and is always worth a visit. Though it gets busy at the weekend with ale trailers.

Because I'm seventy I bought myself a senior's rail pass, which gives me a one-third discount on train tickets. It cost £80 for three years, a cost I'll easily recoup in the first year. One of the big problems of traveling by train is getting to grips with the ticketing system. More about that in a future post.
