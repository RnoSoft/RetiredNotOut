![Leeds Liverpool Canal, Stanley Lock Flight]

Near the end of the Leeds Liverpool canal in Liverpool, there is a flight of four locks leading down to the Stanley Dock, one of the North Liverpool docks. They are known as the [Stanley Lock Flight](https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/things-to-do/walking/canal-and-river-walks-near-me/stanley-lock-flight-wellbeing-walk){:target="_blank"} or the [Stanley Dock Branch](http://www.towpathtreks.co.uk/LLC/stanley_dock_branch.html){:target="_blank"}. 

They were opened in 1846 to provide access from the canal to the North Liverpool docks, when the original route to the Princess Dock was closed due to the arrival of the railways.

Until April 2009 the locks where as far as you go on the canal towards the centre of Liverpool. In that month an extension was opened giving access to the River Mersey via the Pier Head and the Albert Dock (canal boats need to book access to the Albert Dock in advance). 

I visited the locks with my friend John, the other weekend and took many photos. The one above shows some of the locks, the tobacco warehouse, and the railway bridge carrying the Liverpool to Southport and Ormskirk railway over the canal. 

The area is being developed, as shown on the [Tobacco Warehouse website](https://www.tobaccowarehouse.co.uk/location/){:target="_blank"}.

It's an area I'll be visiting a lot over the coming years.
