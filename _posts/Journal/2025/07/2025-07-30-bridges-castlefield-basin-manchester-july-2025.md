![Big bridges across the canal in the Castlefield Basin]

Today I was in Central Manchester walking along the Rochdale Canal from near Picadilly station to the Bridgewater Canal at the Castlefield Basin. Taking photos.

In the Castlefield Basin, three Victorian Railway Bridges cross the Bridgewater Canal in close proximity, as shown in the above photo.

All three bridges used to carry Victorian Railways into Central Manchester. The centre and right-hand bridges carried the tracks into Manchester Central station. The bridge on the right is now the [Castlefield Viaduct Park](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/cheshire-greater-manchester/castlefield-viaduct){:target="_blank"}. The bridge in the middle now carries the Manchester Tram network, heading east and south.

The bridge on the left is still in use and carries the railway into Manchester Picadilly.

The whole area is called the Castlefield Basin. It's a pleasant place to wonder around with many bars and restaurants. Though prices can be on the high side. I had an excellent pint in [Cask](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/cask-manchester-137734){:target="_blank"} on the Liverpool Road. It's a pleasant micro pub but is on the pricy side. I had a pint of Mallinson's bitter at £4.90.

The varied landscape of the basin has been used for many [films and TV dramas](https://screenmanchester.com/locations/castlefield/){:target="_blank"}.

The following photo is the view along the canal towards the bridges, looking north.

The following photo is the view along the canal towards the bridges, looking south. It was taken last June on a sunnier day (today, it was very cloudy).

Back in June, I visited the Castlefield Viaduct Park, I wrote about that visit [here](/journal/castlefield-viaduct-manchester-june-2025).
