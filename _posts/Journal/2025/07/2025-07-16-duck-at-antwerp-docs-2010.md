![Duck at Antwerp Docks One]

A long time ago I had a little duck that I used to take away with me. I don't know where it came from, but I remember it being very dirty when I found it. It was given a bath before its first trip.

I took photos of it as I travelled around. The photos on this page were taken while driving round Antwerp Docks in the summer of 2010.

Sadly, the duck disappeared several years ago. 

It probably sneaked off because it was tired of me.
