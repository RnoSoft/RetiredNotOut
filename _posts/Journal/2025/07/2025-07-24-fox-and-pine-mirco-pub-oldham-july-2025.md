![Fox and Pine, micro pub Oldham]

Today I spent a few very pleasant hours in the early afternoon, supping real ale in the Good Beer Guide listed [Fox and Pine](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/fox-pine-oldham-152891){:target="_blank"} micro pub, Oldham.

It's won numerous awards, including this year's pub of the year award from the [Rochdale, Oldham & Bury](https://rob.camra.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} CAMRA branch.

There are ten handpumps dispensing real ale at £3.80 a pint (which is a bit naughty, I was drinking a 4.0% bitter, subsiding someone drinking a 6.5% stout). It also dispenses at least four real ciders.

They always sell Draught Bass. The Draught Bass drinkers club meets there once a month to sup the beer. I used to love Bass back in the seventies and early eighties. I went off it when they ditched the [Burton Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing_methods#Burton_Union){:target="_blank"} method of brewing.

They used to own the Cob and Coal micro pub in the Market, sadly, it's now closed.

It the background, past the outdoor seating, you can just about make out the [Ashton Arms](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/ashton-arms-oldham-153226){:target="_blank"}, another Good Beer Guide pub. I've been there a few times, and the real ale was always excellent. But I prefer the Fox and Pine.

On this trip I also visited Ashton-Under-Lyme to go to the top of the Ikea store to get some interesting photos looking down towards Central Manchester. I'd visited the store six months or so ago and noticed there were some interesting shots to be had (I didn't have my camera). I didn't get any this time as they've put up a fence blocking the view. Morel of the story, always carry a camera.
