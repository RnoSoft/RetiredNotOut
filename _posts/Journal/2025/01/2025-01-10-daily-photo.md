![Narrowboats on the canal, in snow and ice]

For the last week or so we've had freezing weather here in Marsden. Last Sunday we had snow. For the last three nights or so, the overnight temperatures have reached -10C, which has resulted in the snow turning to ice, solid ice.

Yesterday I decided to brave the Huddersfield Narrow Canal towpath and walk down to Slaithwaite. It's a walk that usually takes around an hour, it took two. Still, it was a nice walk resulting in some nice photos. And more importantly, the weekends supply of wine from Aldi. I got the bus back!
