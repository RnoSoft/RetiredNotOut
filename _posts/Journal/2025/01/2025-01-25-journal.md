![Four bottles of Mallinsons beer infront of our log burner]

One of my favourite breweries is [Mallinsons](https://www.drinkmallinsons.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}, based in Huddersfield. I've never had a beer of theirs that I didn't like. What's really, really good about their  bottled beers, is that they are bottle conditioned.

Outside, its cold wet and windy, the tail end of Storm Eowyn. What better than sitting down in front of a warm fire, reading Bill Bryson, watching TV (not at the same time!) and more importantly, enjoying a beer or four.

They sell their bottled beers at the brewery, a case of twelve for £25.00. It's best to ring them before you go, they might be closed. If you live too far away, you can always have a case or two delivered to your doorstep.

One of my favourite pubs in Huddersfield, the [Sportsman](https://beerhouses.co.uk/the-sportsman/){:target="_blank"}, always seems to have one or two on hand pump.
