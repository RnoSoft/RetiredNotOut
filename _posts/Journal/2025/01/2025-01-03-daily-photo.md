![View across the Duddon Estuary]

Today is another freezing cold day here in Marsden, in-fact, in most of the UK. So, today's photo is of a view across the Duddon Estuary, from Askam in Furness, in Cumbria. It was taken on a bright sunny day in September 2019. It was taken with my old Canon camera.

**This is the last daily photo for a short while, I need to do some more work on properly displaying photos on the website.**
