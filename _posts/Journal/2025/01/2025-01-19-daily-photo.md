![View accross Marsden in the snow]

Today's daily photo was taken during last week's snow. It's a view over Marsden from Carrs Road, close to where I live.

I haven't had a daily photo for a week or so, life has just got in the way again. Most of the week, I just wasn't in the right mood.

A week yesterday a large block of frozen snow fell off our roof and took out the guttering, logia roof and satellite dish. Apparently, we are not covered on our house insurance, even though we have the extra building accident option. I guess I must have missed the damage caused by snow option, or maybe the damage caused by frozen snow option. But then what do you expect from an insurance company. Questions are being asked.

I've also decided to change the website. 

The daily photo feature isn't working. It's a bit difficult to keep up with posting a photo every day, even though I've got lots of them. Also, the winter weather doesn't help with the photography. So, from now on, I won't be posting a photo every day, I'll be posting them most days. So, I need a new name, *A Photo Most Days* doesn't really work!

I've also noticed that I'm starting to write short pieces about things that interest me, or something that's happened to me. 

So, the new name of the daily photo, is going to be *Journal*. 

There will always be a photo at the top of a journal post. If you only want to see my photos just ignore the scribblings below it.
