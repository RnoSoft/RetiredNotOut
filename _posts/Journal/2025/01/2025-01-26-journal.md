![Snowy Marsden, looking over the New Inn towards the Pennines]

Another photo taken during the recent snow. It was taken from behind the park, in Carrs Road, looking over the New Inn towards the Pennines.

Over the next five days, I'll be publishing five more photos of Marsden, taken from Carrs Road, in the recent snow.
