![Wall capping stones painted yellow in attempt to stop theft]

Last week I saw these yellow stones from Waters Lane, when walking towards the old Tunnel End Pub, in Marsden. I thought, why, it doesn't look right to me.

A couple of days ago I went to investigate. Some toerags had stolen many of the capping stones. To try and stop more theft, the farmer owning the field on the right painted the stones yellow. I understand now, and I can't blame him.
