![Setting sun over Marsden, June 2008]

The above photo was taken back in June 2008, using my old Cannon digital camera, which I had just acquired and was learning how to use. It shows the sun setting over Marsden.

Over the last ten days or so I've been bringing my Journal up to date, the first new post is [here](/journal/carrs-road-closure-august-2025). I've also been thinking a lot about where I want to go with it. Because of this, I've not been up to much, especially photography and walking.

I'm not convinced I'm going to get lots of people reading it. It's more for me. In future years I'll be able to look back on previous years to see what I was up to.

Hopefully, its teaching me how to write properly. I didn't think I wrote well, that's the impression I got from my teachers at school. My wife tells me differently. Though I still make silly grammar and spelling mistakes, especially the word were/where (Word does not always get it right). Let me know if you find any bad ones.

It's also being used to teach me how to write and design blogs. Especially how to present and locate information on a website. I've used the Jekyll static website generator to develop this website, but I've found it too limiting. So, over the next eighteen months or so I'm going to be writing my own website generator. I've got a separate website documenting this (I don't want to bore you with computer code), it's [here](https://websitegen.retirednotout.uk/){:target="_blank"}.

I've been a computer programmer all my life; I'm not giving up now. Hence the name of this website, *retired not out*.

I'm seventy and I'm just keeping my mind active.
