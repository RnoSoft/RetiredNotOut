![Pidgeon in York.]

The above photo came from my archive; it was taken in York during Easter 2009. What I was doing there has been lost in the mists of time.

After my week in Liverpool, I did very little this week. The usual reading, watching telly, drinking the odd glass of wine and listening to music. I did quite a lot of programming, I'm in the process of writing my own website generator, more about this in the future. 

It was a quiet week. There was not much to write about.
