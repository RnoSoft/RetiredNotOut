![The front of the Bow-Legged Beagle micro pub.]

After a long walk along the Mersey prom I met John for several bevvies at this excellent [micro pub](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/bow-legged-beagle-new-brighton-132235){:target="_blank"}. A pub I always try to visit when I'm in Liverpool.

John was a little late. Unfortunately, he had a tumble going into town to catch the train here. At Liverpool's Central station someone noticed the blood on his knee and got a first aider to bandage him up. Which was very nice of them.

When I arrived at the pub the shutters were down, what am I going to do I thought. Minutes later they went up, so I had my answer. I took a photo (too much black in it fooled the camera's sensor), then bought myself a pint and sat down for a long rest, to ease my weary bones.

They have five hand pulls and sell bottled beers. John told me that one of the bottled beers is a rare German one. Prices are good but all real ales are priced the same (which is not fair because people drinking weaker beers are subsiding people drinking the stronger ones). The beers cost £3.90 a pint. The ones I tried were excellent.

It's not in the good beer guide, it should be.
