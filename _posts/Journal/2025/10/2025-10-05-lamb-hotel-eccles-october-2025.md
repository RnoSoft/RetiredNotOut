![Outside of the Lamb Hotel Eccles.]

Today my sister got back from her holiday, so it was time to return home.

Tonight, John was going to see a close friend's son play the drums. He was staying in the Travel Lodge at Salford Quays, a short distance by tram from Eccles. To save him catching the train to Manchester, I took him to Eccles (which was on my way home) and dropped him off at this pub. He could then have a few pints before going to his hotel. The tram stop is right outside the pub.

I've been visiting this [pub](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/lamb-hotel-eccles-170906){:target="_blank"} on and off since the late 1970's when I discovered the Holts Brewery. Their beers are excellent and keenly priced. I had a quick pint of mild (I was keen to get home) at £2.70. John later told me that the bitter was £3.40 a pint. It's in this and next year's good beer guide. It's won several awards. It really is a good pub to visit for a few hours.

The pub is rated three stars on Camra's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.

As you can see from the photo, it was raining, the tail end of storm [Amy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Amy){:target="_blank"} was passing by. It passed by on Friday and Saturday, and meant I couldn't do much, especially photography. On Friday I had an afternoon session with john in the [Baltic Fleet](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/baltic-fleet-liverpool-165741){:target="_blank"}. On Saturday I had an afternoon session with john in the [Vernon Arms](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/vernon-arms-liverpool-165852){:target="_blank"}. John tells me the Vernon does excellent food at a decent price, though only on weekdays.
