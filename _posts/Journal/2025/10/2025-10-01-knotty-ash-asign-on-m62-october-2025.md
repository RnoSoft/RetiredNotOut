![Knotty Ash direction sign on the M62.]

The first time I took my future wife to Liverpool, we drove in along the M62. When she saw the above sign, she said something like '*is that a real place*'.

Yes, [Knotty Ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knotty_Ash){:target="_blank"} does exist. I used to live half a mile down the road from it. Though I've never been able to find the Diddy Men or the Jam Butty mines. 

I'm still in Liverpool keeping mum company. But today, I had to return to Marsden briefly. Mum came along for the ride, getting her out of the house for a change.

On my return I got the bus into town and had a minor session with John at the [Ship and Mitre](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/ship-mitre-liverpool-165654){:target="_blank"}. Today I decided to eat out, and had an excellent plate of Fish, Chips and Mushy Peas. They also serves [Scouse](https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/stories/best-scouse-recipe){:target="_blank"}, which I'm told is excellent.
