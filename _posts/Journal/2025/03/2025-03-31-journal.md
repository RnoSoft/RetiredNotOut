![Boats on the sankey kanal at Penketh.]

Today's photo was from more or less the same place as yesterdays, but it's in the opposite direction. 

Both photos show lots of sailing boats, rather than narrow boats which you normally see on a canal. This is because there is a lock (roughly where I was standing) that gives access to the River Mesey, which is tidal at this point.

The location is home to the [Fiddlers Ferry Sailing Club](https://fidlersferrysailing.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} and a boat yard for repairing boats. If you are interested in sailing boats, it's well worth a visit.

We visited the canal in mid-March, and it was very quiet. In the summer it looks like the area gets very busy.
