![Boats on the Sankey Canal at Penketh]

Today is my favourite day of the year, the clocks went forward this morning. So, today it will still be light at half seven in the evening. No prizes for guessing my least favourite day of the year.

A week or two ago I was in Liverpool. On one of the mornings, a bright sunny one, my sister and I went to the [Ferry Tavern](https://www.theferrytavern.com/){:target="_blank"}at Penketh for a quick bevvy. I found the [pub last December](/blog/daily-photo-2024-12-31) and always meant to go back and explore the canal and river by the pub.

There is a very pleasant walk along the canal up to the lock giving access to the Mersey, which is tidal at this point. And then back to the pub. Takes half an hour or so, it depends on how much you linger. Afterwards, you can have a pint or two, sitting on the banks of the river Mersey.

Over the next few days, I'll be publishing more photos taken on the walk.

It's a difficult place to find, usually I do not use sat-nav, my navigations skills are very good (most of the time!), and I love maps. For this journey I used my sisters sat-nav, it's a difficult one. The [Ferry Tavern](https://www.theferrytavern.com/){:target="_blank"} website explains where the pub is and its opening hours. The pub has a car park, if you use it, you really should be having a drink there.
