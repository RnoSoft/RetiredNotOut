![View over St Sever from a cottage we stayed in]

Back in 2013 my wife and I stayed in a cottage in St Sever, Normandy, France. The above photograph is a view of the countryside from the cottage.

Today’s the big day, the PSA test. I’m off to the nurse to give some blood for testing.

The results should be back by tomorrow afternoon.

Trouble is, if I fail, given the state of the NHS, it could be sometime before the next step. It was not too bad waiting for this test, only 4 days, 5 days to the result. Also, there is a possibility that all is OK.

A failure means I may really have prostate cancer, though I’ve read that tests can give a false positive. 

So, the next wait will be more difficult.

The next post about my Prostate Cancer is [here](/journal/prostate-cancer-psa-test-passed).
