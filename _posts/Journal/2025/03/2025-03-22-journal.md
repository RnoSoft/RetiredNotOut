![Hilbre island from the West Kirby war memorial]

When I was at the West Kirby War Memorial the other day, I took the above photo of [Hilbre Island](https://hilbre-island.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}, just off the Wirral Coast.

It was a very hazy day. The photo is not one of my best, but it shows the view from the memorial.

It was taken on my way back home from Liverpool. I drove along the Wirral Coast from New Brighton to Heswall, hoping to take loads of photos. I didn't get many. It was a sunny day, but it was very, very hazy.

You can walk across to Hilbre Island from West Kirby, when the tide is out. Information about the walk and the tides can be found [here](https://hilbre-island.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}. To the best of my knowledge, I've never been there, unless I was taken over as a child and I've forgotten. I plan to change that, this summer.

West Kirby is an excellent place to visit, and it's easy to get there from Liverpool. It takes just over half an hour on the train.

The walk up to the memorial is well worth it for the views. There is also a marina that you can walk around. The views over the River Dee towards Wales are excellent.

With all that walking you'll probably work up a thirst, I recommend the [West Kirby Tap](https://spittingfeathers.co.uk/west-kirby-tap/){:target="_blank"} for a bevy or two. If you are hungry, they do pizzas. It's one of the brewery taps of the Spitting Feathers Brewery.
