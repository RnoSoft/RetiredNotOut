![The Grey Horse pub in Central Manchester, a Hydes Brewery pub]

After walking around Castlefield Viaduct and the surrounding area yesterday, I got thirsty, so I went to the [Grey Horse Pub](https://www.hydesbrewery.com/venue/grey-horse/){:target="_blank"} for a well-earned drink. It's in [Camra's Good Beer Guide](https://camra.org.uk/good-beer-guide?landing_style=good_beer_guide&sort=nearest){:target="_blank"}. 

It's on Portland Street, close to Manchester Picadilly railway station and the coach station, but some way from Victoria station.

It's a Hydes tied house, selling their beers. I was drinking the excellent original bitter, at £3.50 a pint (though I got a 10% discount as a Camra Member). Excellent value for Central Manchester.

It's a small friendly one roomed pub that can get very busy. It opens at noon, which is good if you want an early pint.

It's a pub I've been visiting on and off since the late seventies.
