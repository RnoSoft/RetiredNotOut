![Lock 35E on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal]

Yesterday I was looking at the [Electoral Reform Society](https://electoral-reform.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} website when I came across this [post](https://electoral-reform.org.uk/four-ways-of-electing-a-president-ranked-from-worst-to-best/){:target="_blank"} about the various ways to elect a president. It would seem that the method the Americans use is the worst possible. It's actually worse than first past the post!

Until now I've never really understood the American Electoral College system. I've just found out and it's not good. The post explains the method well and is well reading if you're interested.
