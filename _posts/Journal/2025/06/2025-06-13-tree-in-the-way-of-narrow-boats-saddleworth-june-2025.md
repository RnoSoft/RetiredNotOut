![Tree blocking the canal near Saddleworth]

The other day I was walking along the canal towpath. Just after Slaithwaite I came across a fallen tree, blocking the canal. Hopefully it's been removed by now. It's the tree in the above photo.

It's a real bummer if you are on a narrow boat holiday. 

I've always fancied a narrow boat holiday, but the cost is horrendous, well over a thousand pounds for a week, on a basic boat. We looked at hiring one recently, but decided it was just too expensive. The boats also looked a bit basic.  You can get luxury boats, but they make standard boats look very cheap.
