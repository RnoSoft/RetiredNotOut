![Ship in north Liverpool dock.]

After the Stanley Dock, we drove up the dock road looking for interesting photos. There was only one, shown above. I did this drive last March and only found one interesting photo, I wrote about it [here](/journal/ship-in-north-liverpool-dock-march-2025).

The signs banning photos at Everton's new ground have disappeared, but you still cannot get to the Mersey. We spoke to someone, who said they are still working on the river front, but when all the works are finished it should be possible. Hope so.

Continued on the next post.
