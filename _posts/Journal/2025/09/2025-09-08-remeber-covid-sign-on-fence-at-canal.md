![Sign on canal at Sparth]

A week or so ago a sign appeared on the canal towpath, asking us to limit our use of it. It also said the towpath was strictly for locals.

I thought, that's odd, the waterways website has loads of pages giving details of walks along the canals of Britain. A little bit of inconsistency me thinks.


The sign had appeared on a fence surrounding works at lock 33E of the canal. Reading the sign properly, it's obvious that the sign is from the covid years. It just hasn't been removed from the fence section yet. 

Still, it's a reminder of covid, and how we all suffered.
