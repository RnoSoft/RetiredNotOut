These photos (taken on the 5th of September) show the works at Huddersfield Station, 7 days into its closure. They are extending the lengths of the existing platforms so that longer trains can use the station. They are also adding a fourth through platform. 

The station is obviously closed while the works are taking place. It closed on the 30th of August and is not due to reopen until the 28th of September. 

While closed, there are lots of replacement buses. People wanting through trains to Manchester and Leeds are being bused to Brighouse, to catch a train there. Local services to Stalybridge have a bus replacement service, stopping at stations enroute. A lot, lot slower than the rail service. Similar arrangements are in place for the local trains to Sheffield, Wakefield, Leeds and Bradford.

I wandered past the front of the station twice while taking these photos, both times there were not many people waiting for the buses. It was a Friday afternoon, a day there are usually lots of people traveling. Most people seem to have found other ways of getting to their destination.

I've seen many of the replacement buses passing through Marsden, they always seem to be empty.
