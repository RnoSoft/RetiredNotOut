On the way home, we decided to have a drink in the [No 29 Alehouse and Gin Bar](https://camra.org.uk/pubs/no-29-alehouse-gin-bar-richmond-124319){:target="_blank"} in Richmond, North Yorkshire. It's a new entry in the good beer guide (2026 edition). It's a pleasant place to spend a little time, just out of town on French Gate. Parking can be problematical.

Richmond is a very expensive place and full of money, so I was expecting a very high price for my pint. I was quite surprised; it only cost me £4.80 and was excellent. We sat in the window watching the world go by. 

The food (tapas) looked excellent, but a bit pricy. There was a party of four eating tapas next to us, and they looked and smelt excellent. I suspect this bar is more of an eatery that an ale house. I wouldn't want to spend a lot of time here, but it was pleasant.

The drive back was not good. 

I got lost getting back to the motorway. Getting from the motorway to our house was also a problem due to all the diversions. I don't mind driving along motorways and A-roads, as long as they are not busy. It's the driving around narrow back lanes and busy towns and cities that I hate.
