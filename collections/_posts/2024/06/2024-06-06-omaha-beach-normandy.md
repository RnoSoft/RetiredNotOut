# Omaha Beach, Normandy

*Published by Paul Chappell, 6th June 2024*

Today is the eightieth anniversary of the [D-Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings) landings. 

Back in 2013, my wife and I drove along the French coast to see [Omaha beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach), the sight of one of the landings. It was a peaceful day, hard to believe what happened there 80 years ago. 

The beach was quiet but there were people out fishing with tractors and horses riding along the beach.

Below are some of the photographs I took.
