Today's photo is the road from the mainland to Lindisfarne  Island.

This was taken back in December 2007 and was one the first I every took with my Canon EOS 400D. We were driving home from Berwick Upon Tweed, along the Northumberland coast. I was hoping to get onto Lindisfarne Island, but as you can see, the causeway was flooded. It was a bright sunny day.
