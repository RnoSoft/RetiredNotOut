    <h1 id="photos-taken-on-family-trips-from-2007-to-2012">Photos taken on Family Trips from 2007 to 2012</h1>

<p>Recently, I found several sets of photographs taken on various trips I made with my wife, mother and sister.</p>

<p><a href="/family/a-trip-along-the-wirral-coast">The first set</a> were taken on a cloudy day in September 2007. One Sunday morning we drove along the Wirral coast from Seacombe to West Kirky, stopping at various places along the way.</p>

<p>In early March 2008 we visited Bury Market and had a train ride along the East Lancashire Railway, were I took <a href="/family/a-train-ride-on-the-east-lancs-railway">these photos</a>.</p>

<p>Later the same year we went to the World War 2 day at Haworth, West Yorkshire, where I took <a href="/family/world-war-two-day-haworth">these photos</a>.</p>

<p>In 2010 we all went to Norther France for a holiday, spending two nights in Rouen and one night in Amiens. I took <a href="/family/two-days-in-rouen">these photos</a> while we were wandering around Rouen. On one of days, we went for a drive along the coast, which resulted in <a href="/family/a-drive-to-the-coast-near-rouen">these pictures</a>. The last night of the holiday was spent in Amiens, where I took <a href="/family/a-night-in-amiens">these photos</a>.</p>

<p>In October 2012, we all went to Brugge for a week, which resulted in <a href="/family/a-week-in-brugge">these photos</a>. On one of the days, we drove to Oostende, where I took <a href="/family/a-trip-to-oostende-pier">these photos</a> on the pier.</p>
