<p>Recently, I found several sets of photographs taken on various trips I made with my wife, mother and sister, over ten years ago.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/a-trip-along-the-wirral-coast">The first set</a> were taken on a cloudy day in September 2007. One Sunday morning we drove along the Wirral coast from Seacombe to West Kirkby, stopping off at various places along the way.</p>

<p>In early March 2008 we visited Bury Market and had a train ride along the <a href="https://www.eastlancsrailway.org.uk/" target="_blank">East Lancashire Railway</a>, from Bury to Rawtenstall. The railway is a heritage line, featuring steam trains (with the occasional old diesels). 
I took <a href="/blog/a-train-ride-on-the-east-lancs-railway">these photographs</a> during the trip.</p>

<p><img class="about-image-right" src="/content/blog/2024/06/01-9/002.jpg" alt="Boats on the Beach at Yport, Normandy, France" /></p>

<p>Later the same year we went to the World War 2 day at Haworth, West Yorkshire, where I took <a href="/blog/world-war-two-day-haworth">these photographs</a>.</p>

<p>In 2010 we all went to Northern France for a holiday, spending two nights in Rouen and one night in Amiens. I took <a href="/blog/two-days-in-rouen">these photographs</a> while we were wandering around Rouen. On one of days, we went for a drive along the coast, which resulted in <a href="/blog/a-drive-to-the-coast-near-rouen">these</a>. The last night of the holiday was spent in Amiens, where I took <a href="/blog/a-night-in-amiens">these</a>.</p>

<p>In October 2012, we all went to Brugge for a week, which resulted in <a href="/blog/a-week-in-brugge">these photographs</a>. On one of the days, we drove to Oostende, where I took <a href="/blog/a-trip-to-oostend-pier">these</a> on the pier.</p>
