<p>In the summer of 2022, I went on holiday with my wife, mother and sister to Kirkcudbright.</p>

<p>We chose Kirkcudbright because of this <a href="https://www.packthesuitcases.com/things-to-do-in-kirkcudbright-artists-town-scotland/" target="_blank">post</a> on the <em>Pack the Suitcases</em> blog (a very interesting travel blog, well written and well worth reading). She describes the town a lot better than I can.</p>

<p>Parking in the town was free. This is good because people can pop into town to do a little shopping and don’t have to worry about parking.</p>

<p>It’s a nice place to wander around, lots of art galleries and an interesting harbour.</p>

<p>One thing I liked about the town was the shops, not for the shopping (my wife and I hate shopping) but because of the total lack of chain stores. I always feel that I’m in an interesting place when I don’t recognise the high street shops.</p>

<p>For drinks we used the <a href="https://www.masonic-arms.co.uk/" target="_blank">Masonic Arms</a>. We had several enjoyable sessions there. The beer was always excellent; the pub has been in CAMRA’s Good Beer Guide for several years.</p>

<p>One thing that did disappoint us was that we could not find a restaurant that interested us. Though this was not a problem as we had access to a kitchen to cook our own food.</p>

<p>Apart from the photos I took of the Harbour, most are of poor quality, and cannot be published on this website. The photos I took of the harbour are <a href="/blog/kirkcudbright-harbour-scotland-2022">here</a>.</p>

<p>On one of the days, we drove along the coast visiting various towns. I took <a href="/blog/garlieston-harbour-scotland-2022">these photos</a> of Garlieston Harbour; and <a href="/blog/isle-of-whithorn-harbour-scotland-2022">these photos</a> of the Isle of Whithorn harbour.</p>
