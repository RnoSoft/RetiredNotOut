# Daily Photograph 28th May 2024 

![Todays daily photograph](/content/posts/2024/05/day-photo-28.jpg){:class="img-portrait"}

The photo is of a tram pulling in Piccadilly Gardens tram stop in central Manchester.

I was in Manchester getting the sensor of my camera cleaned. Ten days or so ago, I went to Crosby to see [Antony Gormley's statues on the beach](https://www.sefton.gov.uk/around-sefton/another-place-by-antony-gormley.aspx). When I got home, I started processing the photos of them and noticed several blotches in the sky. A bit of research showed that it was almost certainly dust on the sensor. Yesterday I had the sensor cleaned, and all is OK now.

Sorry for the gap in my daily photos but life got in the way, no camera.
