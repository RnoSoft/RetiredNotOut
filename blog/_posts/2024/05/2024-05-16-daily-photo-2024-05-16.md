# Daily Photograph 16th May 2024

It was taken at the Liberal Club, during the 2008 Marsden Jazz Festival.

I've never had much success taking photos of bands performing. The problem is the lack of lighting (a flash just doesn't work) and getting the expressions on peopleâ€™s faces right. The timing of the shot is very, very important, especially as there is a slight delay between pressing the shutter release and the picture being taken.

I took my camera with me on my walk-through Marsden this morning. But, because the weather was dark and grey (at least it wasn't raining), I did not get any decent photos. So, it's back to the archive again.
