# Daily Photograph 17th May 2024

Liverpool waterfront with the British Antarctic research vessel, the [*Sir Richard Attenborough*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRS_Sir_David_Attenborough). It was taken from the Mersey ferry, enroute from Seacombe to the Pier Head, in the summer of 2021.

It's a photo of Liverpool today, because my wife and I are off to Liverpool for the weekend.
