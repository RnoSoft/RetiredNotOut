# Daily Photograph 14th May 2024

Today was a wet day, so I decided not to go for a walk. So, this one is from my archive. It was taken in April 2011 and shows part of lock 31E on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, looking towards Marsden. In the centre distance, the old Clough Mill can be seen (sadly, it's been pulled down).
