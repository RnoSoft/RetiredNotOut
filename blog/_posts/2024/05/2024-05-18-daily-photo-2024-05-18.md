# Daily Photograph 18th May 2024

The [Augustus John](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/food-and-drink/venues/theaugustusjohnpublichouse.html) pub, Liverpool. A pub at the heart of Liverpool University, that is not just a student bar. We were there for a late afternoon session (Friday) and had a really good time. Lots of room when we arrived (14:30) but getting very busy when we left (18:30).

There was a good choice of real ales, and two ciders, at very good prices (my choice was a 3.8% real ale, at £3 a pint!). My wife drinks wine, the wine she drank was acceptable, and cost around £4 for a large glass (a very, very good price). They do food - pizzas.

The pub is closed on Saturday and Sunday, and at Easter and Christmas.
