# Daily Photograph 30th May 2024 

![Todays daily photograph](/content/posts/2024/05/day-photo-30.jpg){:class="img-landscape"}

Todayâ€™s photo is a milepost just outside Marsden, opposite the Olive Branch restaurant on the A62 (it's difficult to see, but Oldham is 11.5 miles away).

It was taken this morning on yet another grey, dismal, rainy day. Bad light, difficult for photography.
