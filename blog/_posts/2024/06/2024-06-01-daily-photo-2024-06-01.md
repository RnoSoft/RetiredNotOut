# Daily Photograph 1st June 2024 

![Todays daily photograph](/content/posts/2024/06/day-photo-01.jpg){:class="img-portrait"}

Today's photo is of a very rare GR (King George) post-box, seen outside the Post Office at [Llanrhaeadr Ym Mochnant](https://www.bing.com/maps?cp=52.825029%7E-3.306091&lvl=16.0) (near Oswestry), Wales.

No walk today, I'm a bit busy, so this one is from the archive, taken over sixteen years ago.
