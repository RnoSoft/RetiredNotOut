# Posts About the River Mersey

The River Mersey features heavily in my life; I was born in Liverpool in 1955 (which makes me a scouser).

With my new digital camera, I'm starting to collect photos, taken at various locations on the river. This is one of my retirement projects, collecting photos of the river and displaying them on this website. Eventually I'd like to publish a map of the river, with markers showing the location of the various places where I have taken photos.

I have lots of slides and prints showing views of the river, which I hope to digitise them to show them on this website.
