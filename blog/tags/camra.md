# Posts About the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)

I've been a member of [CAMRA](https://camra.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} since January 1974 when I discovered the difference between Keg beer and Real Ale. I joined when I was eighteen years old. I'm now seventy and still a member. 

Why I joined is covered in this [blog post](journal/joining-the-campaign-for-real-ale-in-january-1974).
