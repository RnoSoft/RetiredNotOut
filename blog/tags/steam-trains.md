# Posts About Steam Trains

I've always loved steam trains.

As a young child I lived near the railway, the Canada Dock Branch of the London and Northwestern Railway. I used to love watching the steam engines go by, they seemed so alive.

In 1966 my parents moved to a house near the main railway line between Liverpool and Manchester. Until their demise in 1968, I saw lots of them on that line. I remember walking to school every day, watching a steam hauled goods train passing on the way. You knew it was coming because of the steam put out by the loco. You could see it in the distance, a mile away. I used to wait by a bridge over the line waiting for it to pass. Sometimes I was almost late for school.
