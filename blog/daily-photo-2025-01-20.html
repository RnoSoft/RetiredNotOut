<p>Today’s daily photo was taken during last week’s snow. It’s almost the same as yesterday’s but was taken from a slightly different vantage point.</p>

<p>To get the photo I leaned over someone’s five-foot-high fence. While I was taking it, the owners shouted something like <em>what are you doing</em>. I explained, and lucky for me they were happy about it. They must have been wondering, why was I taking a photo of their garden. I wasn’t, I was taking a photo of the village at high zoom.</p>

<p>Leaning over the fence was not a good idea. If the fence had only been a few feet high, it might not have been a problem. But even then, the house owners probably wouldn’t realise I wasn’t taking a photo of their house, but of a view beyond it.</p>

<p>I’m starting to take lots of photos of Marsden, to publish on this website, so I’m starting to look for new angles. So, I need to take care. The photo didn’t really work. Yesterdays was taken around 50 feet down the road and is much, much better. I’ve only published this photo so I can write about what happened.</p>

<p>I’ll be returning to the issues of taking photos in public, sometime in the future.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.pauldavidsmith.co.uk/photographers-rights/">article</a> covers photographers rights in the UK, in some detail.</p>

<p>Today I start work on changing the daily-photo feature to my journal. There may not be a daily-photo or journal post for a few days.</p>
